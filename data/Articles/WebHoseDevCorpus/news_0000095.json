The United legend gave it his celebrations some welly at 1-0 but was left to regret that later on Instagram. \nJose Mourinho's team did pretty much everything right apart from actually win the match. United dominated pretty much all of the match from start to finish other than a couple of moments but ended up only drawing after Olivier Giroud's late equaliser. \nEarlier on in the match Juan Mata scored a brilliant and difficult stroked shot into the bottom corner of Petr Cech's goal after a brilliant pass from Ander Herrera. That goal caused Rio to celebrate on Twitter, giving his Arsenal followers some abuse \"sit back down Arsenal fans...\" A video posted by Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) on Nov 19, 2016 at 6:09am PST \nUnfortunately for the former centre back and United captain it was Arsenal who had the last laugh. Giroud's header gave the north London side a share of the points. \nIt left Ferdinand visibly gutted: A video posted by Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) on Nov 19, 2016 at 6:19am PST \nThere's just something utterly perfect about the way he says nothing and just lets the radio commentary play to sum up his and many United fans' frustration at the dropped points. \nFor arguably the third occasion this season Mourinho's men could only draw when putting in their best performance of the season.
