It was not immediately clear whether the helicopter had been hit by gunfire or whether another factor caused it to go down. \nCrime and violence have rebounded across Rio, just months after Brazil's second-biggest city hosted the 2016 Olympics. An economic recession, rising unemployment and overstretched public finances have emboldened criminal groups in areas like City of God, one of the best known of the city's so-called favelas, sprawling slums that stretch across vast suburbs and climb up the scenic hillsides of central Rio. \nIn recent years, police had successfully pushed out drug traffickers and other gangs from many favelas. Still, crime is now worsening just as the state government, responsible for most security across a region of more than 16 million people, faces an expected budget shortfall of about 20 billion reais (5 billion pounds). \nAccording to state statistics, the murder rate across Rio through September climbed almost 18 percent from the same period a year earlier, to 3,649 reported deaths. Street crimes, including heists on public transport, surged by 44 percent, to nearly 92,000 reported incidents. \nThough crime in Rio remains far lower than its peak in the 1980s and '90s, recent firefights and the crash on Saturday recalled periods in which the city erupted in conflict. \nIn 2009, drug traffickers shot down a helicopter, killing two crew members, just as police were seeking to \"pacify\" favelas ahead of the Olympics and 2014 World Cup, also played partially in Rio. \n(Reporting by Paulo Prada) Latest AlertNet Crises News Powered by Reuters AlertNet .
