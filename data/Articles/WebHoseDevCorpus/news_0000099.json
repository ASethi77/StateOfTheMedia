Trump wasn’t in the room where it happened but he nevertheless was quick to Tweet his displeasure over Mike Pence ’s raucous reception at Friday night’s performance of Hamilton . The evening was marked by loud boos from audience members when Pence arrived. The show was frequently interrupted by applause for lines in the show that seemed particularly relevant in the wake of the election of Trump and Pence, whose campaign was characterized by overt and covert appeals to white nationalists, Islamophobes, America First isolationists, racists and others in the so-called alt-right movement. The performance at the Richard Rodgers Theatre was capped by a heartfelt, if finger-wagging, speech by Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr in the hit show. It had been quickly cobbled together by composer/lyricist Lin-Manuel Miranda , director Thomas Kail and current cast members, who learned Friday afternoon that the VP-elect would be attending the sold-out musical.\nHere’s video of Dixon’s statement, provided by Team Hamilton and posted on Twitter, followed by responses from the President-elect, Miranda, Dixon, TV’s Kerry Washington and various other politicos, pundits and celebrities. Deadline’s Greg Evans contributed to this report.\nTonight, VP-Elect Mike Pence attended #HamiltonBway . After the show, @BrandonVDixon delivered the following statement on behalf of the show. pic.twitter.com/Jsg9Q1pMZs\n— Hamilton (@HamiltonMusical) November 19, 2016\nIf anyone's giving up their Hamilton tix, please send them to my parents so they stop asking me to get them in and if @Lin_Manuel is nice\n— Zach Braff (@zachbraff) November 19, 2016\nThe Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016\nOur wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016\nProud of @HamiltonMusical . Proud of @BrandonVDixon , for leading with love.\nAnd proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater.\n— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016\nWell said @BrandonVDixon WELL SAID.

And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.\n— Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016\nI wonder if Pence went to Hamilton to take our focus off the Trump University fraud settlement. This administration is morally bankrupt.\n— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 19, 2016\nI thought what the cast of @HamiltonMusical said to our new VP was respectful inclusive and classy. I don't see the \"harassment\".\n— marlon wayans (@MarlonWayans) November 19, 2016\nThe new president elect is telling us what he thinks of our nations great artists @HamiltonMusical .

Take 5 min, call ur Congressmen & make sure hateful Steve Bannon stays out of the White House. #StopBannon\n— billy eichner (@billyeichner) November 19, 2016\nHamilton cast hostility, Warren comments on Trump nominees, Times and Post false coverage,all reminders this will be a permanent campaign\n— Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 19, 2016\nThe arrogance and hostility of the Hamilton cast to the Vice President elect ( a guest at the theater) is a reminder the left still fights.\n— Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 19, 2016\nSomeone should alert Pence about \"You've Got To Be Carefully Taught\" before he goes to see South Pacific next week.\n— Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) November 19, 2016\nThey let Pence into a Broadway theater. Yet he signs into Indiana law that LGBTQ folks can be discriminated against. Who should apologize?\n— Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) November 19, 2016\nOther than that, how was the play, Mrs. Pence?\n— Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) November 19, 2016\nRead More\nThis violates my time and a place mantra.

It should be openly condemned, esp by GOP\n— Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) November 19, 2016\n#BoycottHamilton because the most anti-LGBT governor inAmerica is now VP & why should artists ever feel threatened by that?\n— John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) November 19, 2016\n. @realDonaldTrump demands an apology from cast of @HamiltonMusical . Better he should hear their plea. https://t.co/4l5dpjlIIU\n— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 19, 2016\nTrump says the cast of Hamilton “harassed” Pence (and should apologize). They engaged him respectfully. Perpetual victim Trump lied again.\n— Touré (@Toure) November 19, 2016\nI support Hamilton audience & cast's right to boo/lecture Mike Pence.\nI'd also remind them Hillary & Obama both opposed gay marriage too.\n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) November 19, 2016\nHats off to the cast of \"Hamilton\" for speaking truth to power. Racism is NOT acceptable. Bigotry NOT acceptable.\n— Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) November 19, 2016\nWhen we're done talking about Hamilton, this may also be of interest. https://t.co/SoVOnUGrE0\n— Michael Weiss (@michaeldweiss) November 19, 2016\nVP Elect wasn't harassed at all by the cast of Hamilton.
