-\nFrom Obama down, US officials have stressed that the election has not changed the country's economic and strategic interests, and that Trump may yet recalibrate his views.\n\"How you campaign isn't always the same as how you govern,\" Obama told a town hall meeting of young Latin Americans in Lima.\nMany leaders seem to be hoping as much within APEC -- a 21-member free trade club that accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world's population and nearly 60 percent of the global economy.\nNew Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said he was banking on Trump taking a pragmatic turn away from the extremes of his campaign.\n\"I personally think that President Trump will be like chairman of the corporation Trump,\" he said.\nMexican President Enrique Pena Nieto -- whose country has been the target of some of Trump's harshest vitriol -- said he would seek \"dialogue\" with the president-elect to safeguard the neighbors' crucial trade relationship.\nTrump insulted Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists during the campaign, vowed to force Mexico to pay billions of dollars to build a wall along the border, and threatened to restrict remittances that immigrants in the United States send home.\n- Turning to China -\nIt is unclear whether there is any future for the arduously negotiated TPP.\nThe White House said Obama had \"urged his fellow leaders to continue to work together to advance TPP.\"\nBut many experts say Trump's attacks on the deal and his Republican allies' control of Congress mean it is dead in the water.\nSome leaders and experts said TPP could still be saved in some version.\nOther allies are turning their attention to China's rival plans.\nJapanese leader Shinzo Abe, who took domestic political risks to back TPP, visited Trump in New York on Thursday to hear from the president-elect himself.\nThe demise of TPP will hit especially hard in emerging economies like Vietnam and Malaysia, said Gareth Leather, an economist at consultancy Capital Economics.\n\"The benefits of a China-led regional trade deal are likely to be much smaller,\" he said in a note.\n\"The retreat on the part of America has created an opportunity for China, which was not part of the TPP negotiations, to expand its influence in Asia.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-20T00:35:18.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
