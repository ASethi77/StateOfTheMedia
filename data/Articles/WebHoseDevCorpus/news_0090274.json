According to the hosts, there’s a rumor that Williams had so many naughty outtakes that the director was able to cut R-rated and NC-17-rated special editions of the film. \n“I don’t know about NC-17, but with some of the things he said, I’m sure there was probably an R [rated] cut somewhere,” Wilson admitted on the s pecial, which airs on Sunday. \nFortunately, Williams kept the raunchy humor away from Wilson, who was just 5 at the time. “He was very respectful around me. He had kids himself and obviously he’s known for some of his blue material; he didn’t do that around us,” she said. 20th Century Fox/Courtesy Everett Co \n\n“But he was hilarious, he did all sorts of crazy funny stuff with us all the time, too. We had a lot of fun,” Wilson added. \nRELATED: Mara Wilson Talks To PEOPLE About Child Stardom and Mental Illness \n\nAfter Mrs. Doubtfire , Wilson went on to become one of the most recognizable child stars of the ’90s, appearing as a recurring character in Melrose Place , and then in classic films like the Miracle on 34th Street reboot and Matilda . \nBut by the time she hit puberty, the actress wasn’t getting any parts. “I had good experiences there, but I always knew there were girls much prettier than I was, and I knew that I was always competing with them,” she recently told PEOPLE. “That has followed me my whole life.” \nWilson chronicled her rise to (and escape from) the spotlight in her debut memoir, Where Am I Now?: True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame , which was released in September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-24T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-23T23:06:56.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
