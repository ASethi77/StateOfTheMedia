Tamarind rind is used to flavor curries and preserve fish. The tamarind rind contains a chemical called hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been studied for its effect on appetite. Garcinia cambogia supplements with HCA are marketed for weight loss. Garcinia cambogia has also been used as a dietary supplement for rheumatism, intestinal problems, and other conditions. Garcinia cambogia is made into a tea, capsules, extracts, tablets, and lotion. How Much Do We Know? Garcinia cambogia has been studied for weight loss, but there aren’t a lot of recent, reliable studies on its effectiveness. What Have We Learned? There’s no convincing evidence that garcinia cambogia will help you lose weight or control cholesterol. In a very small study, women who were overweight were given garcinia cambogia extract or a placebo for 60 days. Triglyceride levels of the participants getting garcinia cambogia decreased by almost one-third. Triglycerides are a type of fat in blood and high levels may raise a person’s risk of developing heart disease. The participants’ HDL (the “good” cholesterol), LDL (the “bad” cholesterol), total cholesterol, and body weight didn’t change. In another study, people who were overweight were given either garcinia cambogia extract, soy leaf extract, or a placebo. After 10 weeks, none of the supplements promoted weight loss or lowered total cholesterol. What Do We Know About Safety? Taking garcinia cambogia for short periods (12 weeks or less) appears safe for most people. Keep in Mind Tell all your health care providers about any complementary or integrative health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. Key References Astell KJ, Mathai ML, Su XQ.
