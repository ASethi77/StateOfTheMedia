Heyward, who is likely the Steelers' best defensive player, was injured during the team's loss to the Dallas Cowboys last week. \nOn Saturday, the Steelers officially placed Heyward on injured reserve, ending his season. The team did the same with wide receiver Markus Wheaton , who suffered a shoulder injury during practice prior to last week's game. In a related move, the Steelers activated linebacker Bud Dupree , who was their 2015 first-round pick, and promoted running back Daryl Richardson from the practice squad. \nThey announced the series of moves via Twitter: We have placed DE Cameron Heyward and WR Markus Wheaton on the Reserve/Injured list, activated LB Bud Dupree & promoted RB Daryl Richardson. — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) November 19, 2016 \nDupree had been out for the entire season so far after undergoing surgery on a core muscle during the preseason. He played a decent-sized role for the Steelers as a rookie, collecting four sacks while playing just over 52 percent of the team's defensive snaps, per Pro Football Focus. With Heyward out, they will surely need him to put some pressure on the opposing passer every week. \nWheaton's absence presumably means that Antonio Brown , Eli Rogers , Cobi Hamilton , and Sammie Coates will continue to see the majority of the snaps at wide receiver for the Steelers. Rogers has assumed Wheaton's usual role in the slot quite nicely over the last few weeks. \nRichardson, meanwhile, should be expected to work far behind Le'Veon Bell in the backfield. It would be a surprise if he touched the ball while Bell is healthy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-19T23:15:39.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
