I think it \n(Thanksgiving holiday) opened up trading opportunity for the \nlocals,\" said Grace Aller, an analyst with AP Securities. \nThe dollar rose to an eight-month high against the yen on \nFriday as U.S. bond yields resumed their rise in Asia after the \nThanksgiving break shut markets in the United States. \nStrong U.S. manufacturing and consumer data this week have \nalso bolstered the surge in the dollar. \nRecent robust data from the United States and China showed \nthat the world's largest economies are doing well. \nThis shows that the major economies are steadying, easing \nthe flow of bad economic data into smaller markets by removing \nexternal headwinds, Aller said. \nSingapore shares rose for a fourth straight session, \nhelped by consumer and financial stocks, and added 0.7 percent \nthis week in their third straight weekly gain. \nAgribusiness group Wilmar International Ltd \nclimbed 3.76 percent, while DBS Group Holdings Ltd \ngained 1.5 percent. \nSentiment was also buoyed by the city-state's \nstronger-than-expected manufacturing growth in October. \nThai shares rose for the fourth session in five, led \nby consumer and healthcare stocks, and posted a weekly gain of \n1.8 percent. \nMalaysian shares rose marginally and logged a weekly \ngain of 0.2 percent, their first in four weeks. \nGovernment data out earlier in the day showed that \nMalaysia's consumer price index increased 1.4 \npercent from a year earlier, slightly slower than the previous \nmonth's pace. \nBucking the trend, Vietnam shares fell for a second \nsession, but gained 0.4 percent for the week. \nFor Asian Companies click; \nSOUTHEAST ASIAN STOCK MARKETS: Change on day \nMarket Current Previous Close Pct Move \nSingapore 2859.33 2843.72 0.55 \nBangkok 1500.4 1490.11 0.69 \nManila 6889.78 6873.31 0.24 \nJakarta 5122.104 5107.623 0.28 \nKuala Lumpur 1627.26 1624.21 0.19 \nHo Chi Minh 675.87 678.18 -0.34 \nChange on year \nMarket Current End 2015 Pct Move \nSingapore 2859.33 2882.73 -0.81 \nBangkok 1500.4 1288.02 16.49 \nManila 6889.78 6952.08 -0.90 \nJakarta 5122.104 4593.008 11.52 \nKuala Lumpur 1627.26 1692.51 -3.86 \nHo Chi Minh 675.87 579.03 16.72 \n(Reporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu \nSahu)", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-25T13:18:36.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
