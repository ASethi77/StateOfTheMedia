The county clerk's director of logistics and training, Judy Owens, sent a memo to the election judges who oversee the polling locations on Monday, clarifying the proper language.” \n>> Trump surges to 12 point lead in Texas, CBS DFW \n-- The family that doesn’t vote together: “George P. Bush says he's the only member of his powerful political family who will be voting straight-ticket Republican and says his grandfather and uncle, both former presidents, could ‘potentially’ cast ballots for Hillary Clinton. Bush was addressing a small Republican rally in San Marcos, Texas, Tuesday night. He was pressed later by The Associated Press to clarify his remarks. He said then of George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush: ‘I don't know how they voted. I'm speculating, to be honest.’ Asked if either could vote for Clinton, Bush answered: ‘Potentially. But hard to speculate.’” ( AP ) \n-- Per the Statesman’s Chuck Lindell : “ Defense lawyers have dropped pretrial efforts to dismiss criminal charges against Attorney General Ken Paxton, ending his appeals and moving Paxton one step closer to trial.” \n-- “The Texas Education Agency told 11 school boards and superintendents they must take special training because their plans for fixing underperforming schools haven't made the grade,” reports the Texas Tribune’s Aliyya Swaby . \n>> Intense power struggle likely awaits Texans returning to Congress, The Texas Tribune \nCAPITOL DAYBOOK - No meetings \nIf it’s election season, things are getting nasty in Windcrest, San Antonio Express-News \nCornyn raises $18M for GOP candidates, Politico \nAustin paper (still) not endorsing candidates in Nov. elections, PolitiFact Texas \nNote to capitalists: Cuba is still communist, Houston Chronicle \nNorth Dakota officials borrow $4M, slam feds on protest cost, AP \nReligious Freedom is Only for Christians in Texas, The Texas Observer \nSid Miller’s Twitter Implosion, Texas Monthly \nWhat Not To Do On Election Day in Texas, Texas Monthly \nTravis County candidates offer different ideas on transportation fixes, Austin-American Statesman \nAustin police could use Dallas lab to address DNA test backlog, Austin-American Statesman \nFormer Dallas federal prosecutors join bipartisan criticism of FBI director Comey over Clinton announcement, The Dallas Morning News \nParents say kids are being mistreated at one of Dallas' biggest charter schools, The Dallas Morning News \nRACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE \n-- 5 DAYS … “Hillary Clinton is pressing into reliably red Arizona as she tries to steal a Republican state away from Donald Trump.
