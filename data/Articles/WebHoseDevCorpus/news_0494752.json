On Friday, many Twitter users shared clips from Jolie’s video that showed the mother of six wearing a black blazer and top. \n“Successful prosecution and new legal benchmark, whether at the ICC or elsewhere is part of the long and vital generational effort. That is the light in which I believe the court’s new policy on children should be seen,” Jolie, 41, said, adding, “I particularly welcome the commitment to include charges for crimes against children wherever the evidence permits as part of a more systematic approach. I congratulate the office of the chief prosecutor, and all those working on the policy.” #AngelinaJolie welcomes #OTP policy: Mankind owes to #children .
