Brown/AFP/Getty Images) James Rufus Koren & Co., requiring it to get approval to replace or hire new executives and make other changes, in the latest fallout over the San Francisco bank’s fake-accounts scandal.\nLate Friday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the regulators that reached a $185 million settlement with the bank over the creation of unauthorized customer accounts, issued a brief statement saying it was revoking some of the terms of that Sept. 8 deal. \nSpecifically, the OCC said it was canceling parts of the agreement that had shielded Wells Fargo from some oversight usually reserved for troubled banks. \nThe OCC did not issue a statement explaining the cancellation, but Wade Francis, a former OCC bank examiner, said the move amounts to a regulatory vote of no-confidence in the bank’s leadership. \n“This is the OCC saying, ‘We don’t trust you to run your business,’” said Francis, president of Long Beach bank consultancy Unicon Financial Services. “They’re questioning the judgment of management.” \nWells Fargo will have to provide the OCC with written notices if it plans to replace board members or bank executives. The changes appear to apply only to Wells Fargo Bank, which has a separate board from corporate parent Wells Fargo & Co. It’s not clear whether the change would have had any impact on Wells Fargo’s appointment of a new chief executive last month. \nThe bank will also no longer be entitled to expedited regulatory reviews of applications for basic practices, including opening or relocating bank branches. The regulatory order further prohibits the bank from making so-called golden parachute payments — compensation paid to executives when they step down or are fired. \nSuch bans are typically imposed only on banks that are troubled or insolvent. “It’s the OCC saying they don’t trust the bank to be prudent,” Francis said. \nWells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment. \nIn a statement to the Wall Street Journal, bank spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said the new order “will not inhibit our ability to executive our strategy.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nSome Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists , the Rams break ground on their new stadium , Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration , and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake .
