That was off by a tenth of a rating point and up a notch in the share from the previous SNF game between the Green Bay Packers and the Washington Redskins (11.9/19). Last night’s result was on the higher end of SNF metered market deliveries in what has been a rough fall for NFL football on TV. The Chiefs’ overtime win in Denver topped both the last Chiefs SNF game (11.0/18 vs. Pittsburgh on October 2, 2016) and the last Broncos SNF game (11.7/19 vs. Oakland on November 6, 2016). In the non-time zone adjusted fast nationals, SNF was up week-to-week by 0.2 in adults 18-49. ABC’s Quantico (0.7) was flat week-to-week in its fall finale. It’s been a tough start of the second season for the terrorism drama after a breakout fall 2015 run — it drew a 0.6-0.7 adults 18-49 Live+same day ratings for its five most recent episodes. Despite solid DVR bumps, that is too small of a base to go off of. ABC is throwing the sophomore drama a lifeline with a scheduling upgrade. Quantico will move to Mondays after the winter break, taking over the 10 PM slot from freshman Conviction, w hich did not get a back order . ( The fate of any remaining Conviction originals is TBD.) Quantico , which like the new season of Homeland features a female US president, will benefit from a stronger lead-in from Dancing with the Stars on Monday. On Sunday, it was preceded by Secrets & Lies (0.7, even with last week). At 8 PM, Once Upon a Time (1.0) recovered a bit from the all-time low two weeks ago with a 0.1 uptick. CBS’ Sunday lineup was delayed by 49 minutes following NFL coverage. Rough initial estimates have NCIS: Los Angeles at 1.4, Madam Secretary at 0.9 and Elementary ( from 11-11:30 PM) at 0.6. All numbers are off by a tenth from last Sunday, with NCIS: LA poised to again rank as the top scripted program on Sunday. Fox’s lone original was Bob’s Burgers (1.1). NBC is projected to win the night in all key measures.
