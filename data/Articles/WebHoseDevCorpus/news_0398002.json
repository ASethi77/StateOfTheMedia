But Donald Trump victories in states such as Florida, North Carolina and Ohio sapped their enthusiasm.\nAmericans in the audience say they’ve always felt welcome in Mexico, even as Trump unleashed tough talk about America’s southern neighbor, calling Mexican migrants “rapists” and robbers and promising to build a border wall. Some wonder how they will be treated if he wins.\n“They don’t blame us for Trump,” said Rosa Baum, a San Francisco native, working in Mexico with a human rights group. “They’re often expressing empathy.”\nTrump’s strong performance appeared to cause alarm in the Mexican government. The newspaper Reforma reported the country’s foreign minister Cluadia Ruiz Massieu left her election war room for an urgent meeting in Los Pinos, the president’s residence.\nEarly returns showing a strong Trump performance also sent the peso plunging. Mexico has opened its economy over the past 25 years, betting big on NAFTA – only to see a rising tide of protectionism – causing concerns of a recession.\nOthers worry of mass deportations with a Trump administration, saying the sad-sacked pueblos many Mexicans left behind — and prop up with remittances — can’t handle an influx.\n“How could you create new jobs for 2 or 3 or even 4 million of deportees?” asked Rodolfo Soriano-Nuñez, a sociologist in Mexico City.\nTrump’s promise of a wall is considered a non-starter in Mexico — much less paying for it. But Soriano-Núñez said, “If they actually go for the wall, the pressure will be very hard on the Mexican government.”\nIronically, Trump’s emergence comes as surveys show Mexicans, increasingly, embracing the U.S. and casting aside anti-Americanism. Some wonder if that will endure.\n“It’s so sad to see an ideology that’s so demeaning to the Mexican population,” said Elizabeth Téliz, a university student. “We’re so close. We should have have good relations.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-09T07:21:45.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 14, "shares": 14, "comments": 357}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
