It was centered 119 miles (192 kilometers) south of Santiago at a depth of 54 miles (87 kilometers).\nChile’s navy issued a statement saying a tsunami was unlikely to hit the country’s long coast.\nOfficials said they had no immediate reports of damage, though the quake interrupted telephone service briefly.\nChile is highly earthquake-prone. In 2010, a magnitude 8.8 quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, unleashed a devastating tsunami and killed more than 500 people while destroying more than 220,000 homes. The quake prompted the Andean nation to improve its alert systems for both quakes and tsunamis.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
