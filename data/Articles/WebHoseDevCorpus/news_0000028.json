Wider availability — basically the rest of the country — will need to wait until 2017 says The Wall Street Journal .\nThe paper spoke to GM spokeswoman Michelle Malcho, who said the company is \"focusing on this year getting the cars ready for customers,\" and will be delivering vehicles to other states at a slower pace. Despite high interest in the vehicle, the Bolt will only be available in \"limited quantities\" throughout 2017.\nThe $30,000 electric vehicle has an EPA-estimated range of 238 miles on a full charge, is significantly cheaper than the only other 200-plus-mile electric vehicles on the market, and arrives on the market a year before Tesla’s Model 3 .\nVia : The Wall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-20T00:50:14.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
