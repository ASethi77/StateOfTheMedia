The 20-year-old from England birdied the course's four par-5 holes -- the first, sixth, 14th and 17th -- and the par-4 10th and 13th as well in a bogey-free round to stand on 13-under 203 after 54 holes.\nAmerican Brittany Lincicome also fired a 66 at Tiburon Golf Club to stand second on 204 alongside South Korean Ryu So-Yeon, who shot 69 on the Naples, Florida, layout.\nNew Zealand's world number one Lydia Ko had a chance to grab a share of the lead with a birdie on the closing hole but took a bogey to finish a round of 73 and share fourth on 205 with South Korea's Chun In-Gee, Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn and Americans Jennifer Song and Lizette Salas .\nThe stumble left Ko, 19, second in the race for the $1 million playoff bonus behind Jutanugarn entering the final round.\nHull, ranked 29th, seeks her first title since winning the Ladies European Tour's Lalla Meryem Cup at Morocco in March of 2014 at age 17.\nHull recorded her best career major finish this year, sharing second at the ANA Inspiration, the best of her four top-10 showings this season.\nLincicome birdied the second, fourth, sixth and eighth holes before a bogey at the ninth. On the back nine, she birdied three of the first five holes and answered a bogey at 16 with a birdie at the 17th.\nRyu birdied the second hole but took her lone bogey at the third before bouncing back with birdies at six and seven. She birdied the par-3 12th and closed with six pars in a row to stay on Hull's heels.\nKo, who led after a course-record 62 Friday, also went birdie-bogey at two and three but could not recover as well, taking bogey at the seventh before a birdie at the par-3 eighth. She made another bogey at 15 but responded with a birdie at 17 before closing with a bogey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-20T00:23:45.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
