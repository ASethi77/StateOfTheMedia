Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces. Al-Aridi said militants were fighting back with snipers, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar rounds. \nThick black columns of smoke were seen billowing from the two areas, while dozens of civilians fled to government-controlled areas. A suicide bomber emerged from a house in the Tahrir neighborhood and attacked security forces, wounding four troops. And another suicide car bomber hit troops in Aden neighborhood, killing a soldier and wounding three others. \nTo the west of Mosul, government-sanctioned Shiite militias took full control of the Tal Afar military airfield Friday night, said Jaafar al-Husseini , a spokesman for the influential Hezbollah Brigades. Al-Husseini said the clashes almost destroyed the airport and that it will be an important launching pad for the troops in their advance. \nThe extremist group captured Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, in the summer of 2014. The offensive to retake the city, which was launched on Oct. 17, is the biggest military operation in Iraq since American troops left in 2011. If successful, the retaking of Mosul would be the strongest blow dealt to the Islamic State.
