New York housing police Chief James Secreto says one male and one female officer encountered the man around 1 p.m. Saturday on the ninth floor of the Van Dyke Houses in the Brownsville neighborhood. The New York Police Department's Housing Bureau officers were responding to a 911 call reporting a suspicious person. When they asked for his ID, a scuffle ensued during which Secreto says the man grabbed one officer's collapsible, metal baton and struck both in the head. The chief says the officers fired, killing the man. One officer suffered a gash, the other suffered contusions. Authorities did not immediately release the names of those involved. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-20T01:26:27.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
