But Donald says what he means and means what he says,” Stone told The Post. \n“They have to have an alternative that’s market-based. It can be done. Look, the ObamaCare exchanges have crashed. The insurers are pulling out,” the longtime Trump adviser said. \nHealthGrove | Graphiq But he also insisted Trump won’t leave people in the lurch, including millions of low-income Americans who qualified for Medicaid through ObamaCare. \n“Donald has said repeatedly he won’t put people out on the street without medical coverage,” Stone said.\nJonathan Gruber, the MIT professor who helped design the Affordable Care Act, said Trump is playing with fire.\n“If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, you’re taking away coverage from millions of people. I have not seen an alternative. There isn’t one,” Gruber told The Post.\nRepealing the law would allow insurers to discriminate against sick people, since it currently bars them from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, he said.\nThe ACA “has been a big success in New York state. We don’t want to go backwards,” said David Sandman, president of the New York State Health Foundation.\n“It’s not easy taking the law apart . . . Finding a way to retain medical coverage for 22 million is a problem.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under barack obama ,  donald trump ,  healthcare ,  obamacare ,  republicans", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-11T08:12:24.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 2}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "facebook": {"likes": 784, "shares": 784, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
