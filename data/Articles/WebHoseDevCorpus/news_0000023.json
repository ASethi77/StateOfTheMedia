Back in Antigua, 30 painters, stonemasons, electricians and carpenters have been working frantically to complete a three- year project to rebuild the historic house after it was badly damaged by a hurricane in 1998. British businessman Peter Harrison pledged Â£2.4 million to restore the property to its original glory. The 200-year-old former residence of the Commissioner of the Royal Navy Dockyard was a favourite spot of Princess Margaret Antique: Clarence House has an 18th Century throne inside a chest of drawers Preparations are still on going to finish the restoration work before the arrival of Prince Harry When The Mail on Sunday visited yesterday, some workers were still laying bricks outside. Others were cutting metal for the railings and burning lead over a fire to weld them into place. Tiles were being laid outside while staff polished the wooden floors and builders shifted debris in trucks. Trustee Reginald Murphy, who is overseeing the restoration, said the Royal visit came as a surprise. 'It has been a bit hectic,' he said. 'There were rumours, but we didn't know Prince Harry was going to come here until the last month. We were aiming to complete this in the first couple of weeks in December, so we moved it forward a month.' Missing him already... Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's girlfriend, is home alone A unique feature of the renovated building is the 18th Century chamber pot built into a chest of drawers. Dr Murphy said: 'You pull out the drawer and then you sit on it to do your business. Poor people would have just shoved it under the bed, but this was a more fancy option. 'If Prince Harry wants to test it, then he is welcome to have a go. 'But he has to be the one to dump it afterwards!'
