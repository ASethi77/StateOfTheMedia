And later, during the song What Comes Next? , King George III actor Rory O'Malley had to stop the song briefly after the crowd \"went nuts\" at the line \"When your people say they hate you, don't come crawling back to me\" and ask them to stop booing.\nI'm at #Hamilton and so is Mike Pence. Crowd booed him like crazy, and gave a standing O at the line \"immigrants we get the job done\" 1/2\n— Christy Colburn (@christymoose) November 19, 2016\nBy now, you've likely seen the video from the curtain call, when Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, addressed Pence on behalf of \"diverse Americans who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us\" and asked the vice president-elect to \"uphold our inalienable rights and work on behalf of all of us.\"\nPresident-elect Donald Trump demanded the cast apologize for harassing Pence, but by all accounts, both Dixon and the vice president-elect were respectful of one another. In fact, Dixon even thanked the Indiana governor for listening to what he had to say.\n@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.\n— Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016\nEven creator Lin-Manuel Miranda weighed in during a break from doing Moana interviews in the U.K., complimenting the cast for how they handled the situation and agreeing with Trump that everyone should be welcome at the theater.\nProud of @HamiltonMusical . Proud of @BrandonVDixon , for leading with love.\nAnd proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater.\n— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016\n© AP Wait for it.\nAnd original cast member Christopher Jackson, who gives his last performance as George Washington Sunday , summed up his cast's statement as \"citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS with respect and clarity.\"\nJust LISTEN to the words! Ain't nothing but Citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS! WITH RESPECT and CLARITY! #AMENandAMEN https://t.co/J6UhrwW1FP\n— Christopher Jackson (@ChrisisSingin) November 19, 2016\nBut social media has not settled down since, erupting with hashtags like #BoycottHamilton . (Proponents of that movement will have to be very patient: the show is sold until September 2017.)\nHere is a sampling of the most viral comments on Twitter.\nDesperate times, desperate measures Frozen star Josh Gad , who originated the role of Elder Cunningham in The Book of Mormon , provided some context in a Twitter statement. \"I know the booing upsets some of you,\" he wrote. \"But this is what happens when you run on a platform of hate.\" While he says he personally wouldn't boo someone at a theater, \"this feels different. There are swastikas popping up everywhere, a cabinet of civil-rights offenders and deniers being built, and a leader who has placed a white nationalist by his side. These aren't attempts at unity. These are warning shots to everyone who isn't white, straight and extreme.\"\nIf we're talking about apologies ...\nAmericans don't need to apologize-not even to presidents or vice presidents-for the lawful & proper exercise of their constitutional rights. https://t.co/daN147yjkM\n— ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016\nAn apology should instead come from President-elect Trump for calling into question appropriateness of @HamiltonMusical cast's statements.\n— ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016\nIt's called misdirection Garden State 's Zach Braff chalked the whole controversy up as a win for Trump, who successfully distracted the country from Friday's $25 million Trump University settlement .\nWhen you settle a fraud lawsuit for 25 million dollars but everyone's talking about Hamilton. pic.twitter.com/KFgqMJsxul\n— Zach Braff (@zachbraff) November 19, 2016\nAnyway, doesn't the president-elect have better things to do right now?\nMy story on Trump's fight with Hamilton https://t.co/xCX7xoPK35 pic.twitter.com/ahyPWPmNZX\n— Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) November 19, 2016\nPsst, that's not how a boycott works\nAre you going to #BoycottHamilton like you Boycott Starbucks? If so, enjoy the show!\n— Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) November 19, 2016\nBut if you're looking to unload tickets you already have, there are plenty of takers\nSo uh if you're gonna #BoycottHamilton , can I have your tickets? I didn't realize speaking with respect was considered harassing in 2016.\n— Mike Burgholzer (@MikeBz15) November 19, 2016\nHold up! What if it was all one just of Joe Biden's pranks?\nBiden: I sent Pence tickets to Hamilton\nObama: Joe..why\nBiden: just watch\nObama: pic.twitter.com/7uxLBiidbL\n— Erika 📎 (@ErikaBuis) November 19,
