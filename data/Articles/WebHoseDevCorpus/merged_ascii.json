Ko also is fighting Jutanugarn for the money title and Chun for the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average.\n\"It's simple: I got win to get it.\" Ko said. \"That's why no matter what position I am, I'm the chaser.

Published:November 21, 2016 4:47 pm Ousted Tata chairman Cyrus Mistry. (File) \nIT major Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCSL) on Monday pointed out that Tata Sons? ousted Chairman Cryus Mistry has caused enormous harm to the company and its shareholders. ?Mistry?s conduct has caused enormous harm to the Tata group, TCSL and its stakeholders, including employees and shareholders,? the company said in a regulatory filing to the BSE. \nWatch What Else Is making News \n?Subsequent to his replacement as executive chairman of Tata Sons, Mistry has made certain unsubstantiated allegations, which cast aspersions not only on Tata Sons and its board of directors, but also on the Tata group as a whole, of which TCSL is an integral part,? the regulatory filing said under the ?explanatory statement? note. \nThe company made the regulatory filing to inform the BSE that an extra ordinary general meeting (EGM) will be held on December 13, 2016. \nOn November 17, the board of directors of the IT major decided to convene an EGM to remove Mistry as a director of the company. \nEarlier, TCS issued a special notice under Section 169 (read with Section 115) of the Companies Act, 2013, and made a requisition for an EGM of shareholders to consider Mistry?s removal as a director of TCS. \nTCS has already replaced Mistry as its Chairman and appointed Ishaat Hussain as the new Chairman of the board of directors of the company with immediate effect. \n?It may be noted that the board of directors of Tata Sons has lost confidence in Cyrus P. Mistry to lead Tata Sons for a combination of several factors,? the company?s regulatory filing elaborated. \n?The Tata Sons? board, in its collective wisdom, took the decision to replace Mistry. The Board had felt that the removal of Mistry as Chairman was absolutely necessary for the future success of the Tata group.? \nTata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group companies, removed Mistry, 48, as its Chairman last month and reinstated Ratan Tata in an interim capacity. \nTata Sons in an earlier statement has said that ousted Chairman should resign from all group companies and deplored the manner in which Mistry has sought the support of independent directors of Indian Hotels to continue as its Chairman.

Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984. But Bush and Reagan both did far better with Hispanic voters, capturing 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively, according to exit polling data compiled by the non-partisan Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. \nAnd Trump?s performance among Asian-Americans was the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in 1992. \nThe racial polarization behind Trump?s victory has helped set the stage for tensions that have surfaced repeatedly since the election, in white supremacist victory celebrations, in anti-Trump protests and civil rights rallies, and in hundreds of racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic hate crimes documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks extremist movements. The SPLC reports there were 701 incidents of ?hateful harassment and intimidation? between the day following the Nov. 8 election and Nov. 16, with a spike in such incidents in the immediate wake of the vote. \nSigns point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation. \nThe Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a white separatist group that vilifies African-Americans, Jews and other minorities, plans an unusual Dec. 3 rally in North Carolina to celebrate Trump?s victory. Left-wing and anarchist groups have called for organized protests to disrupt the president-elect?s Jan. 20 inauguration. And a ?Women?s March on Washington,? scheduled for the following day, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to protest Trump?s presidency. \nAmerican politics became increasingly racialized through President Barack Obama?s two terms, ?but there was an attempt across the board, across the parties, to keep those tensions under the surface,? says Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University. \nTrump?s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric ?brought those divisions to the fore; it activated people on the right, who felt empowered, and it activated people on the left, who saw it as a threat,? she added. \nThat dynamic was evident last week. \nWhen Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway musical ?Hamilton? in New York on Friday, the multi-ethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fears of a Trump presidency. A far different view was on display the next day as a crowd of about 275 people cheered Trump?s election at a Washington conference of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist group with a strong anti-Semitic beliefs. \n?We willed Donald Trump into office; we made this dream our reality,? NPI President Richard Spencer said. After outlining a vision of America as ?a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity,? he closed with, ?Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!? \nDIVISION BREEDS CONFRONTATION \nThough Trump?s election victory was driven by white voters, his performance even among that group was not as strong as some of his predecessors. Reagan and George H.W. Bush both won the presidency with higher shares of the white vote than the 55 percent that Trump achieved. \nThe historical voting patterns reflect decades of polarization in American politics, but the division surrounding Trump appears more profound, says Cas Mudde, an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the University of Georgia. These days, he adds, ?people say they don?t want their children even to date someone from the other party.? \nIndeed, voters? opinions of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic lows. Surveys by the Pew Research Center showed this year that majorities of both parties held ?very unfavorable? views of the other party ? a first since the center first measured such sentiment in 1992. \nAnd the lion?s share of those people believe the opposing party?s policies ?are so misguided that they threaten the nation?s well-being,? the center found. \nThat level of division has spurred activists on both sides of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction. \nIn the wake of Trump?s victory, protesters on the left took to the streets by the thousands in cities across the country, in some cases causing property damage. \nMuch of the agitation was motivated by a belief that Trump?s administration will foster racism and push the courts and other political institutions to disenfranchise minority voters, says James Anderson, editor of ItsGoingDown.Org, an anarchist website that has promoted mass demonstrations against Trump?s presidency, including a call to disrupt his inauguration. \nMany on the left have come to distrust government institutions, embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see as condemnable political forces, Anderson says. ?The answer now is to organize, build power and autonomy and fight back.? \nOn the opposite end of the political spectrum, Trump?s election is bringing new hope for right-wing activists who felt abandoned by the major parties. \nJohn Roberts, a top officer in the Ku Klux Klan affiliate planning the December rally to celebrate Trump?s election, says the group is committed to non-violent demonstrations, but he sees Trump?s election as likely to bring a new era of political conflict. And much of the strife, he says, will be centered around racial divisions. \n?Once Trump officially takes office, there is going to be a boiling over at some point in time,?

Thanks to stellar 3-point shooting and an intact starting lineup, they got what they needed. \nJohn Wall had 23 points and 11 assists as the Washington Wizards snapped a three-game losing streak with a 119-112 win over the New York Knicks on Thursday night. \nThe Wizards (3-8) returned home after a demoralizing 109-102 loss Wednesday to a one-win Philadelphia 76ers squad during which they trailed by as many as 24 points. \nWashington reversed course dramatically by sinking 15 of 25 3-pointers and limiting New York's offense for most of the game. \nOtto Porter scored 21 points as Washington led by 27 points in the second half. Bradley Beal had 18 points in his return after missing the previous three games with a hamstring injury. \n\"We definitely needed this,\" said Porter, who also impressed defensively against New York star Carmelo Anthony. \"Coming out with a mindset of being aggressive and being physical.\" \nDerrick Rose had 27 points for the Knicks (5-7), who had won two straight. Anthony scored 19 points on 17 field goal attempts. \nNew York scored 47 points in the fourth quarter, but inconsistency put them in trouble. \nWashington led 52-42 at halftime before outscoring New York 35-23 in the third quarter. Marcus Thornton added 13 points off the bench for Washington. His 3-pointer gave the Wizards an 87-60 lead. \n\"It takes a lot of effort. A lot of energy,\" Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek of remaining focused when playing back-to-back games. \"I think the guys played a lot of minutes last night. That probably didn't help as much in terms of them having that type of effort that you need to stop some guys.\" \nDown 22 points with 4:33 remaining, the Knicks scored 12 straight points deep into the fourth quarter. That forced the Wizards to put their starters back into the game, but New York couldn't pull closer than seven points. \nKristaps Porzingis scored 16 points in 37 minutes one night after pouring in a career-high 35 over 40 minutes in New York's 105-102 win over the Detroit Pistons. \n\"I think they were playing tighter defense than they were last night,\" the second-year standout said. \"Maybe I should have been more aggressive.\" \n\"He's going to have to learn how to play in back-to-back games,\" Hornacek said of Porzingis. \"It's tough on a guy that's 7'3\". That was probably my fault for playing him so much last night. We were trying to get the win last night. He played great. We just have to keep going.\" \nMarcin Gortat had 16 points and for Washington. \nBrandon Jennings had 17 for the Knicks, who labored on both ends of the court in the first half. Porter scored 13 points and Washington started 8 of 10 from beyond the 3-point arc while shooting 51.2 percent from the field. New York missed 9 of 11 3-pointers and shot 37.5 percent overall before halftime. \nNew York finished 12 of 29 from beyond the arc and 47.7 percent from the field. \nWall made all three of his 3-point attempts in the third quarter as Washington shot 61.9 percent from the field in the period. \n\"We played a great basketball game for us (especially) after a tough loss last night,\" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \"Guys really competed, moved the ball. Having Brad out there, we're a different team.\" \nNOTES: Head-to-head with New York, Washington owns a three-game winning streak and has 10 wins in the past 11 meetings. The sides will meet three more times this season. The Knicks last won the season series in 2012-13. ... New York coach Jeff Hornacek is hopeful F Lance Thomas (sore left ankle) can return to the lineup early next week. Thomas last played Nov. 12. ...

Thinkstock \nThis fact sheet provides basic information about garcinia cambogia?common names, usefulness and safety, and resources for more information. \nCommon Names: garcinia cambogia, garcinia, Malabar tamarind, brindle berry Latin Name: Garcinia cambogia Background The garcinia cambogia tree, which grows in India, produces a fruit called tamarind. Tamarind rind is used to flavor curries and preserve fish. The tamarind rind contains a chemical called hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been studied for its effect on appetite. Garcinia cambogia supplements with HCA are marketed for weight loss. Garcinia cambogia has also been used as a dietary supplement for rheumatism, intestinal problems, and other conditions. Garcinia cambogia is made into a tea, capsules, extracts, tablets, and lotion. How Much Do We Know? Garcinia cambogia has been studied for weight loss, but there aren?t a lot of recent, reliable studies on its effectiveness. What Have We Learned? There?s no convincing evidence that garcinia cambogia will help you lose weight or control cholesterol. In a very small study, women who were overweight were given garcinia cambogia extract or a placebo for 60 days. Triglyceride levels of the participants getting garcinia cambogia decreased by almost one-third. Triglycerides are a type of fat in blood and high levels may raise a person?s risk of developing heart disease. The participants? HDL (the ?good? cholesterol), LDL (the ?bad? cholesterol), total cholesterol, and body weight didn?t change. In another study, people who were overweight were given either garcinia cambogia extract, soy leaf extract, or a placebo. After 10 weeks, none of the supplements promoted weight loss or lowered total cholesterol. What Do We Know About Safety? Taking garcinia cambogia for short periods (12 weeks or less) appears safe for most people. Keep in Mind Tell all your health care providers about any complementary or integrative health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. Key References Astell KJ, Mathai ML, Su XQ.

The tale of these three broken souls is translated by professor Alok Mukherjee at the request of a beautiful stranger, whose life is bound to Cyrah?s and Fenrir?s.\nInfomocracy\nBy Malka Older (Tor)\nIn this futuristic world with eerie parallels to current events, countries are micromanaged by centenals, mini-democracies that vote on which global government they want to join. Elections are held every 10 years so that there is ?time for governing in between bouts of politics.? An organization called Information, which oversees everything, is overloaded with personal data and ripe for corruption. With an election looming, Supermajority Heritage will do anything to keep its lead, and its rival Liberty isn?t above a little manipulation of its own.\n\"The Unfinished World: And Other Stories\" by Amber Sparks. (Liveright)\n\"Version Control\" by Dexter Palmer. (Pantheon) The Unfinished World\nBy Amber Sparks (Liveright)\nA masterful collection of speculative fiction. One particularly powerful tale, ?The Janitor in Space,? is a lyrical exploration of a woman?s choice to live on a space station as penance for past sins. Sparks experiments with form in ?The Logic of the Loaded Heart,? a story presented as word problems. Familial relationships are strained in ?The Lizzie Borden Jazz Babies? when one twin plans to start dating, the other to start murdering. The titular ? and longest ? story focuses on a young boy named Set growing up during World War I with an eccentric, dysfunctional family that wonders whether the boy has a soul.\nVersion Control\nBy Dexter Palmer (Pantheon)\nRebecca Wright, is a high-functioning alcoholic in a loveless marriage. Her growing unease is suddenly disrupted by a car accident that destabilizes her future in unforeseen ways. In one version of this time-traveling world, she has lost her son in a car crash. In another, it is her husband who is the casualty. Rebecca comes to realize that the world is horribly ?upside down? in either version, and it is up to her to create a narrative that makes sense.\nNancy Hightower is author of the books ? The Acolyte ? and ?

Photo: Kirk Sides Atascocita leaves little for debate, beats Pearland to advance to regional semifinals 1 / 11 Back to Gallery \nIt doesn't matter to Atascocita coach Craig Stump if quarterback Daveon Boyd is handing off, passing, lateraling or running the ball. \nJust as long as the final result is achieved. \nBoyd left little for Stump to debate Saturday at NRG Stadium as the versatile senior accounted for 374 total yards and four touchdowns in Atascocita's 35-14 win over Pearland in a Class 6A Division I area football matchup. \nThe win sends the Eagles (10-1) into the regional semifinals against Lamar (11-1) at 4 p.m. Friday at NRG Stadium. \nAtascocita led just 14-7 at halftime, but it pulled away with big plays on offense and defense. \n\"Any time you give up seven points in a half, you should be able to give yourself a good chance to win,\" Stump said. \"We scored first in the second half, and then it got a little frustrating when we fumbled down there on the 1. \n\"I didn't think it was a fumble, but who knows? You have to give the ball to the official. There are no replays in high school. But we continued to move the ball and the defense made good stops.\" \nResponded early, often \nBoyd completed 21 of 33 passes for 303 yards and two touchdown passes while rushing for 71 yards and scoring on runs of two and five yards. \nHe threw a 30-yard scoring pass to Lujuan Winningham at 3:24 of the third quarter as Atascocita opened a 21-7 cushion. When Pearland cut the gap to 21-14, Boyd had to go to work again. \nHe responded admirably, guiding Atasocita on two consecutive scoring drives. \nThat 28-14 lead swelled to 35-14 just 1:46 later following an interception by Joshua Escobedo . \nAtasocita needed to travel just 17 yards and did so in four plays, capped by Boyd's 5-yard scoring run with 7:12 left. \nThat TD provided more than enough cushion for the Eagles. \n\"Them making crucial third-down plays and us not making them was the difference,\" Pearland coach Tony Heath said. \"Our defense finally wore out. Our offense just didn't give the defense the opportunity to rest ? and give them some life. \n\"We've played with a short stick most of the year, and we've just patched it up every week. We gave a great effort. Atascocita just has a lot of weapons. \n\"This is the class they've been waiting for. They have talent at quarterback, in the slots, at running back and in both lines. They're a good football team.\" \nSpreading the ball \nAtascocita's fumble at the Oilers' 1-yard line came on its first possession in the second half, but it didn't prove fatal in the long run. \nThe Eagles' defense was up to the task, while Boyd kept drives alive by connecting with Winningham (seven catches, 111 yards, two scores) and Alerick Soularie (6-120-0). \n\"The thing is, it was those two guys (Winningham and Soularie) this week, and it was another guy last week,\" Stump said. \"You look at our stats and it's spread around. I call things based on defense, not who's in the game. They're all expected to make it happen.\" \nAtascocita led Pearland (8-4) 14-7 at halftime following a scoreless first quarter. \nPearland (8-4) scored the game's first points on its initial possession of the second period, moving 74 yards in six plays to take a 7-0 advantage at the 10:10 mark. \nA 16-yard completion from Oiler quarterback Whitehead to wide receiver Christian Lake moved Pearland to its 44 yard line. \nThree plays later, Oiler running back Jaelin Benefield broke through the front wall of the Atascocita defense and found open space en route to a 44-yard scoring run. \nTwo possessions later, the Eagles produced the equalizing score after Atasocita's Jaylon Allen pounced on a muffed punt at the Pearland 25 yard line. \nThe Eagles needed five plays to reach the end zone, using a fourth-and-1 run of four yards by Demmerritte to reach the Pearland 12. \nFrom there, Daveon Boyd fired a scoring strike to Winningham on a slant route with 6:43 left in the half, and David Heaton 's PAT kick tied the game at 7. \nAtascocita grabbed the 7-point halftime cushion courtesy of an 8-play, 54-yard march which culminated with Boyd's 2-yard sweep of right end.The biggest installment in that march was a 32-yard third-down pass from Boyd to Demmerritte.

Save University of Central Florida \nScientists from the University of Central Florida (UCF) have created a supercapacitor battery prototype that works like new even after being recharged 30,000 times. The research could yield high-capacity, ultra-fast-charging batteries that last over 20 times longer than a conventional lithium-ion cell. \"You could charge your mobile phone in a few seconds and you wouldn't need to charge it again for over a week,\" says UCF postdoctoral associate Nitin Choudhary. \nSupercapacitors can be charged quickly because they store electricity statically on the surface of a material, rather than using chemical reactions like batteries. That requires \"two-dimensional\" material sheets with large surface areas that can hold lots of electrons. However, much of the research, including that by EV-maker Henrik Fisker and UCLA , uses graphene as the two-dimensional material. \nYeonwoong \"Eric\" Jung from UCF says it's a challenge to integrate graphene with other materials used in supercapacitors, though. That's why his team wrapped 2D metal materials (TMDs) just a few atoms thick around highly-conductive 1D nanowires, letting electrons pass quickly from the core to the shell. That yielded a fast charging material with high energy and power density that's relatively simple to produce. \"We developed a simple chemical synthesis approach so we can very nicely integrate the existing materials with the two-dimensional materials,\" Jung says. \nThe research is in early days and not ready for commercialization, but it looks promising. \"\"For small electronic devices, our materials are surpassing the conventional ones worldwide in terms of energy density, power density and cyclic stability,\" Choudhary said. \nJung calls the research \"proof-of-concept,\" and the team is now trying to patent its new process. While it could go nowhere like many other battery developments, it's worth looking at new supercapacitor research closely. If commercialized, it could allow for longer-range EVs that can be charged in minutes rather than hours, long-lasting (non-explosive) smartphones that can be charged in seconds and grid or home energy storage solutions that drastically reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

You are not alone.?\n?I hear from a lot of people that they are afraid, because violence doesn't start with a fist, it starts with an idea,\" Holzhauer said. \"Before the Holocaust, there was 12 years of name-calling to make a group of people outside the norm of society.

Venezuela?s opposition said on Wednesday that talks with the government were ?frozen? after officials failed to attend meetings the previous day, throwing cold water on Vatican-brokered attempts to bridge the country?s deep political crisis. Though the formal talks started last month appeared linked to the release of a handful of detained activists in past weeks, hopes for real rapprochement were always slim. The two sides are fundamentally at loggerheads, with the opposition seeking the ouster of Socialist President Nicolas Maduro, while authorities vow he will not leave office before his term ends in 2019. Opposition activists suggested Maduro backed away from the talks after the National Assembly on Tuesday held a heated session in which they slammed him over a drug scandal involving his family. Two nephews of Cilia Flores, Maduro?s wife and a ruling party lawmaker, were found guilty this month on U.S. charges that they tried to carry out a multimillion-dollar drug deal to obtain a large amount of cash to help their family stay in power. ?The government, in an irresponsible manner, froze the dialogue process by not showing up to two technical meetings last night,? the leader of the opposition coalition, Jesus Torrealba, told Reuters. The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the state of dialogue with the opposition. It was not clear if the talks could be revived, or if the opposition would resume a more militant agenda, which before the talks included street protests and a plan to put Maduro on trial before the National Assembly. Dialogue had divided parts of the diverse opposition coalition, with some activists feeling the government was using them to buy time without making any real concessions. Previous sit-downs in recent years eased some tensions in the streets, but also showed little progress on core issues. The situation in oil-rich Venezuela has worsened in the past few months, with a recession leaving millions unable to find or afford food amid shortages and spiraling inflation. The opposition blames Maduro, who is unpopular, for the crisis, and has been vying to remove him via a recall referendum. The former bus driver and union leader, however, has said the opposition is actually seeking to foment a veiled coup against him and has vowed to see out his term through 2019.

Izzo said. ?It might not be for a while.? \nFreshman Miles Bridges had 22 points and a season-high 15 rebounds to lead the Spartans. \nEron Harris added 14 points for the Spartans, while Tum Tum Nairn Jr. ? a native of nearby Nassau ? matched his career high of 13 points in his return to the Bahamas. \nMichigan State has had a bumpy start to the season, starting with a loss to Arizona on a last-second basket in the opener. \nThe Spartans managed just 48 points in a loss to current No. 1 Kentucky and barely beat Florida Gulf Coast at home over the weekend. It?s part of a tough opening month that concludes with a trip to preseason No. 1 Duke in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge. \n?There?s some frustrating moments, and it?s not all their fault,?

Blame our horrible timing on The History Channel , which shared a video about a monstrosity of an asteroid named Apophis , ?after the ancient Egyptian god of destruction.? Just in case Earthbound life doesn?t already present us with enough mundane issues to worry about, this asteroid is reportedly three football fields wide and would make an impact 1,000 times the atomic bomb that struck Hiroshima , except, as Slate points out, Apophis won?t actually hit earth in 2036 , as was previously believed. Despite the false alarm, we totally get why people continue to freak out over the possibility of asteroid-induced mass destruction that would bring about the annihilation of at least one major city. Luckily though, NASA?s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (coolest workplace ever) is in charge of handling such incidents with plans that involve detecting, assessing and ultimately protecting the planet from dangerous asteroids with the help of high-powered instruments such as cameras and a telescope that, according to Scientific American , ?is designed to spot dangerous asteroids shortly before their final plunge to Earth.? Thankfully, we can rest easy (for now) with the knowledge that Apophis will bypass Earth in 2036 from a very comfortable 150 lunar distances away. We?re beyond relieved because we?ll probably need way more than 20 years to save up enough money for a one-way ticket to Mars .", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-27T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-26T21:59:34.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

More Seattleites have been fans of fresh-grown produce and locally raised meat long before farm-to-table became a buzzword. Case in point: Our biggest tourist attraction, Pike Place Market , has been a working farmers market since 1907. Situated in the heart of downtown, this bustling spot has nearby chefs and residents stocking up their larders amid crowds of camera-touting tourists. Seattle?s latest market on the block is equally urban, but in a decidedly modern way. The Night Market at Chophouse Row is nestled between historic, mixed-use buildings in Capitol Hill. Though just steps away from busy Pike Street, the market is an oasis of cosmopolitan cool. In Chophouse Row?s architecturally stunning courtyard, vendor tents are tucked beneath twinkling lights strung between glass facades, concrete beams, and brick walls. Shopping for Brussels sprouts has never been so stylish. This Wednesday-evening market is the brainchild of the James Beard Award-winning chef Matt Dillon, the owner of Chophouse Row?s Upper Bar Ferdinand . A longtime champion of the region?s farmed, foraged, and fished bounty, Dillon created this metropolitan mercantile to connect local farmers to city dwellers. One of the first vendors at the market, which just took root Nov. 2, is the Puget Sound Food Hub , a farmer-owned cooperative of regional, independent family farms. They sell seasonal produce, which currently includes a wintry rainbow of radicchio, carrots, and savoy cabbage. Dillon?s Vashon Island farm, Old Chaser Farm , provides additional produce as well as eggs. Tonnemaker Family Orchards has organic pears and apples and their addictive fruit leather on hand. Bonus for all you bread-lovers: You can buy Plane Bread?s transcendent artisanal sourdough loaves, which were previously only available at Dillon?s London Plane . Specialty coffee roaster Honor Society Coffee has whole beans as well as steaming cups of joe to fuel your shopping. They share table space with Amandine Bakeshop?s transcendent macarons and pastries. In the spirit of urban community upon which Chophouse Row was founded, each week, the market has a rotation of guest stalls showcasing design, craft, and culinary goods by the building?s retail tenants and local businesses. Be sure to save time for lingering at one of the Night Market?s epicurean neighbors. Grab a scoop of tomato jam ice cream from Kurt Farm Shop ; a glass of gamay (or a bottle to go) from Upper Bar Ferdinand; or a bite at Marmite, Bruce and Sara Naftaly?s soon-to-open French caf?. The Night Market at Chophouse Row, 1424 11th Avenue, runs every Wednesday from 4 to 8 p.m., rain or shine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-04T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-04T03:53:14.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

But instead we?ve chosen to be out on the course?to be sure, a rear-guard action?valiantly struggling to keep playing the game.\nUnique in sports, and a wonderful thing it is, the game of golf depends in very large measure on the honesty of its participants. And that honesty, in turn, requires adhering strictly to the various rules set down from time to time by the USGA, the sport?s regulatory body in the U.S. The rules often are complex. But to play the game properly, a golfer?whether a touring professional competing for vast sums or a high-handicap amateur like me?must abide by them.\nI don?t believe for a moment that the USGA has deliberately tried to make the game more difficult just for seniors. The rules are set down impartially for all who choose to play the game?young, old and everyone in between. Nonetheless, a couple of rule changes instituted this year seem to hit those of us with more experience a bit harder than others.\nLet me explain.\nBattle against the yips A widespread problem as golfers grow older is the onset of the putting yips, a nervous flinching of the wrists, especially on shorter putts. This dreaded affliction rarely bothers younger players. But it is common among seniors whose nerves tend often to be more fragile.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/Encore More in Encore: The New Retirement Five Myths About Landing a Good Job Later in Life What Ever Happened to That Old 401(k) You Had? How to Use Technology to Connect to Grandchildren If You?re Thinking of Retiring in Ecuador Best Books of 2016 for People of a Certain Age ?I Used to Be So Cool. What Happened?? An antidote had until recently been to acquire a longer, heavier putter and then to anchor the grip against the chest to reduce or even eliminate any flinching. But now, just when at last I had pretty well used this technique to conquer my late-in-life entanglement with the yips, the USGA rules people have declared no more anchoring. They were careful, however, not to ban the long putter itself, no doubt mindful that such a prohibition might trigger lawsuits by its producers. But without anchoring, the long and heavy putters can become unwieldy and far less helpful against the yips.\nThat was rule change No. 1. The second change was even more discouraging for those of us whose partners from the old days grow ever scarcer, forcing us to discover the considerable joys of playing alone. Specifically, the rules people have outlawed submitting scores played solo.\nFor those of us who play most of our rounds alone, that means fewer rounds will count toward calculating a handicap, which very likely will mean a less accurate handicap. That?s no small thing on those rare days when I do compete against friends for a few dollars.\nWriting of the joys of solo golf in The Wall Street Journal in 2013, I noted enthusiastically that a solitary golfer, using however many handicap strokes may be allowed, may compete quite happily ?against the course? and ?record an accurate score.? This score, in turn, may be submitted, I wrote, so as to maintain an accurate handicap.\nBut no more. Now I am instructed that I must bring along at least one ?companion? to verify my score before submission. Would my 10-year-old granddaughter do if she knows the rules? If the purpose of this new ban is to keep me honest, why not let me simply post my score and then agree to a polygraph test at the 19th hole? Or better yet, why not just keep counting on the honesty of golfers?\nAs to the suggestion, which the rules people make, that playing alone somehow may distort one?s performance, I simply don?t buy it. My scores alone pretty much match my scores on the rare occasions when I play with others.\nHow do such rule changes originate?\nThe U.S. Golf Association bears no love for older players of the game, judging by some of its recent rule changes. Photo: iStockphoto/Getty Images The anchoring ban was instituted because, the USGA maintains, the proper golf stroke requires ?freely swinging the entire club,? which anchoring makes impossible. And, the USGA reasons, scores for rounds played solo lack ?peer review.? Having companions along, in the USGA?s view, will provide ?a more accurate view of a golfer?s ability.?\nThe croquet putt The late Sam Snead suggested to me that USGA rulings may occasionally reflect more subjective considerations. In the twilight of his great career, battling the yips, Snead adopted a croquet-style of putting, where he faced the hole with the club positioned between his legs. He was playing in the Masters tournament, Snead recalled, with the revered Bobby Jones looking on. Jones, he said, was ?appalled? at the spectacle and told a USGA official next to him that this was no way to play the game of golf. A short while later, the USGA banned a croquet-style putt.\nPreviously in Encore It?s Time to Rethink the Bucket List Retirement (March 2016) How Technology Will Transform Retirement (November 2015) To Age Well, Change How You Feel About Aging (October 2015) Snead resorted to a sidesaddle style where he still faced the hole, but with his putter held awkwardly to the side. Somehow the sidesaddle approach passed muster with the USGA. But how, I ask, is that a less ?appalling? way to putt than the outlawed croquet technique? (Remarkably, the rules people neglected to forbid the croquet style for balls hit from just inches just off the green. An oversight? Go figure.)\nAs for me, I plan to continue playing alone much of the time, even occasionally using my long putter anchored to my chest.

And they are now fighting to keep whatever they might have, the fire wall in some of the battlegrounds with early voters, who they know are heading to the polls right now. ABC's Cecilia Vega in Ohio. Reporter: In Ohio, where voting is already under way, tonight, Hillary Clinton trying to tackle the political firestorm engulfing her campaign. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new e-mail story is about, and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing, with just days to go. That's a good question. Reporter: Clinton putting on a defiant front. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my e-mails for the last year. There is no case here. Reporter: Clinton's team now counting on their get out the vote operation. More than 23 million votes already cast. Democrats outpacing Republicans in gaslegrobat pl grounds like Nevada and North Carolina. But in all-important Florida, it is Republicans with a slight edge in early voting. Here in Ohio, most Clinton supporters we spoke to brushed off this new chapter in the e-mail saga. If I say to you, Hillary Clinton and e-mails, you say -- I don't care -- I don't believe it -- Reporter: You can't say the word you want to say. I don't care. Reporter: Does this make you reconsider your vote at all? Not at all. Reporter: I am running against a man -- Clinton trying to focus back on her point. When the election is over, and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all of these weighty decisions. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. And Cecilia Vega joins us tonight from Cincinnati. Cecilia, you've been hearing that Hillary Clinton and the campaign will try to take this to Donald Trump in these final days, she wants to turn the focus back to trump. But even the Clinton campaign knows that it's going to be a tough task, given the new headlines about the e-mail. Reporter: They certainly do, but they're not giving up. The very last thing they want to be talking about this close to election day is these e-mails. They are bringing in other heavy hitters to try to change the subject, too. President Obama, vice president Biden will be out on the trail this week. David, you can imagine they'll be hitting Donald Trump, as well. Cecilia Vega right there in Ohio for us. Thank you.

Photo: Ron Schwane, AP Browns coach Jackson emotional after 12th straight loss 1 / 5 Back to Gallery CLEVELAND (AP) ? Hue Jackson struggled to push out the words. A season he never fathomed reached another low point on Sunday, and as Cleveland's first-year coach wrestled to put it into perspective, Jackson paused to gather himself. He tapped the side of the podium with his right hand and pursed his lips as his eyes welled up. This hurts. \"Being 0-12 is probably the hardest thing ever,\" Jackson said after the Browns lost 27-13 to the New York Giants . Unfortunately, with four games left, it might get harder for him. Following the game, Jackson, saddled with a rookie-laden roster, met with Cleveland's \"upper management\" in his office before his news conference. Jackson insisted the discussion had nothing to do with his job status or future, and he's as committed as ever to turning Cleveland into a winner. But until that day arrives, Jackson has no choice but to keep teaching, motivating and pushing his players, who are hoping to avoid joining the 2008 Detroit Lions as the only teams to go 0-16. \"I have never been through this,\" he said. \"But I am not going to fall off a cliff or anything like that. These guys, these players, this organization, and the (ownership) group mean too much to me for me to ever feel like that. Do I ever get disappointed and frustrated? Yes, I do not want you guys to feel like I do not. I do not want you guys to think I do not get mad or sad or disappointed. I go through all of those emotions. \"At the same, I know what I signed up for. I know through our injuries and the things we have been through this season where we are and where we are trying to go. You can either beat yourself up, and I do that enough, or you can just put your head down and keep fighting and push through this. That is what we are going to do as a football team and as an organization.\" As has been the case most of this season, the Browns just didn't have enough talent ? or luck ? to pull out a win. They were within 20-13 in the fourth quarter before Eli Manning threw his second touchdown pass to Odell Beckham Jr. New York's defense put an exclamation point on the Giants' sixth straight win by sacking Josh McCown a few more times in the final minutes. McCown was dropped seven times as the Browns again struggled to protect their quarterback. Cleveland had two chances to score touchdowns in the first half, but had its drives stall and settled for field goals by Cody Parkey . That's been a familiar and frustrating pattern for Jackson, an offensive mastermind who just doesn't have enough weapons. If there's a shred of good news it's that the Browns have a bye next week, giving the coaching staff and players a break from the misery. Jackson said he'll devote the time off to fixing his team. \"It has been a long 12 weeks,\" he said, \"and unfortunate for the men in that room over there, we have not been able to get them a win yet. We will go back to the drawing board, and we will come back tomorrow. I know these guys will come to work, they will be ready to go and we will work through tomorrow. Then they will get out of here and we will self-scout ourselves and see where we are and go from there.\" Jackson brushed aside a question about his job security, saying he has the full support of owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam . He added they have continued to hold positive discussions about the team's struggles. \"In these times of toughness and times of crisis, you have to have good strong conversation,\" he said. \"It is healthy and it is good. That is how you do not go through these things in the future. You work through those things and you talk through them so that you can come on the other side, and they have been great with me from top to bottom. \"Hopefully, they feel the same from me to them. I don't like losing. I never have and I never will, and I have had my butt kicked up over my shoulders enough this season that I really don't need my butt kicked anymore. I have to figure out how to quit getting my butt kicked. It is just that simple.\" ___ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-28T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-28T05:40:14.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

Instead of converted Victorian tenements, think brand-new strip malls (and even a 1970s-style enclosed mall), postwar Levittown-style ranch houses and 1970s office parks and apartment complexes. From the air, it looks like any other automobile-friendly shopping district. But oh, what a difference when you are the ground. There is some debate as to whether \"Chinatown\" suffices to encompass the multitude of Asian cultures visitors will find within its boundaries. Yes, the street signs along Bellaire Boulevard from South Gessner to roughly Beltway 8 are posted in Mandarin characters as well as English script, but go further west and they change to Vietnamese. (The Chinese name for Bellaire translates to \"Hundreds of Profits,\" while the Vietnamese have renamed the same street Saigon Boulevard.) Read More And while those two cultures are easily the most visible in the roughly six-square-mile area, they are far from the only ones you will find. Moshi Moshi Gifts on Bellaire Boulevard stocks an array of playful products. 'Asiatown' might be more apt Case in point: Dun Huang Plaza, a four-building, two-story strip mall complex at 9889 Bellaire, just east of Beltway 8. With its long procession of cramped strip malls adjacent to but apart from one another, this Chinatown is paradoxically both dense and sprawling. Because the area is so difficult to thoroughly explore in a single day, Dun Huang is your best bet for a relatively bite-sized, one-stop experience -- a pan-Asian riot of retail, restaurants and relaxation. First, those restaurants. A visitor could easily spend several days here and not sample the same cuisine twice at lunch, dinner or as bar bites over late-night cocktails. The variety of cuisines to choose from at lunch and dinner shows why \"Asiatown\" might be a more apt name than Chinatown. At Dun Huang Plaza alone, diners can choose from Japanese, Cantonese, Taiwanese, Hunan, Hong Kong, Vietnamese, Korean and Malaysian fare. Asian bakeries offer your best option for breakfast. Six Ping (Suite D-246) is highly recommended for its pastries both sweet (Japanese cheesecake, mochi and red beans, gigantic macarons and Hello Kitty cakes) and savory (a variety of pork and sausage buns.) Most of Six Ping's offerings come in at around two dollars, so you get plenty of carbs for your money. You'd be hard-pressed to find Hunan cuisine as spicy or authentic as what's on offer at Hunan Bistro . Bold diners can sample fish heads, frog legs, chicken feet and pork bellies, while those reluctant to make the complete leap over the Great Wall can tuck into more familiar fare like whole fish, beef, lamb, tofu and chicken. Unless specified otherwise, be prepared for your mouth to be set alight with spices, and beware the numbing properties of Sichuan peppercorns, which despite the restaurant's Hunan designation, are in evidence in some dishes here. Along with its famed hot pots with names like \"Prosper at 5 a.m.\" and \"Top Notch Pot of the Outlaws,\" Sichuan peppercorns are the stock in trade of Mala Sichuan, a few blocks east at 9348 Bellaire. Dense with dining and shopping, too Those in search of even more exotic regional Chinese fare can find it at Uyghur Bistro , which offers spicy halal kebabs, noodles and lamb dishes from China's Islamic far western Xinjiang Autonomous Region (9888 Bellaire, across the street from Dun Huang Plaza). Rival Malaysian restaurants stare each other down across the Dun Huang parking lot -- the intimate Banana Leaf and the more imposing Mamak, which offers diners a window into the kitchen, where cooks toss roti dough overhead like pizza chefs. This naan-like crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside roti bread is served as an appetizer to be dipped in curry sauces. (Broadly speaking, Malay cuisine is a cross between Indian, Cantonese and Indonesian.) A fried noodle dish, mee goreng, is on the menu at Mamak Malaysian restaurant. Like most Dun Huang restaurants, Mamak offers lunch specials for under $7. Here that could get you okra and shrimp in Malaysian sauce, rendang beef or Hainanese chicken, each with a mound of rice. While Houston's 2014-era ramen craze has abated somewhat, Dun Huang's Tiger Den still draws crowds to its doors each day for its 5 p.m. opening. Throngs gather to poke their chopsticks in steaming bowls of miso, tantan and tonkotsu soups, while late-night visitors to Dun Huang flock to the bar at GiAu Bar N' Bites, an occasionally raucous Vietnamese lounge/tapas bar where the \"avocado bomb\" sushi roll has garnered a serious cult following. Though famed primarily as a dining destination, Dun Huang offers a handful of prime shopping spots as well. Chinese bric-a-brac (including electric firecrackers!) is the stock in trade of LP Trading, while my tween daughter adores browsing the Japanese knick-knacks at Fit , on Dun Huang's top floor. She also loves the plush and cuddly inventory (if not the higher prices) at Moshi Moshi Gifts (9108 Bellaire). Vietnamese with a dash of Cajun Shopping -- for jewelry, apparel, religious statuary and electronics -- supplants dining as the primary function at Hong Kong City Mall (11205 Bellaire), although there are dining options there as well. Despite its name, Hong Kong City Mall is heavily Vietnamese, its food court a great place to grab a cool glass of bubble tea, a thick, sweet Vietnamese iced coffee, a crispy banh mi sandwich, a bowl of pho or a pile of Vietnamese-style boiled crawfish. One possible shopping break? A bubble tea from Kim's Teahouse. Houston has long enjoyed its close proximity to Louisiana cooking, but Vietnamese-Americans, more of whom call Houston home than anywhere in America outside of the Los Angeles area, have kicked up the Bayou City's long-popular crawfish game considerably, resulting in a dish some have crowned as Houston's signature food. Their mudbugs are boiled in a broth that uses both traditional Cajun ingredients and lemongrass and ginger, and the finished product is dipped in a spicy butter/garlic sauce. Hong Kong City's Crawfish Cafe is a prime spot to grab a pound or five, as are Crawfish & Noodles (11360 Bellaire), Cajun Kitchen (6938 Wilcrest) and Hank's Cajun Crawfish (10800 Bellaire). Hong Kong City's food court and outdoor pagodas are always the scene of many a heated game of xiangqi (Chinese chess), with rival masters nipping on cans of Budweiser and sometimes drawing crowds of nail-biting onlookers. The mall is anchored by a somewhat dingy if giant and spectacularly well-stocked Hong Kong Food Market, its produce section groaning under the weight of spiky durian fruits and an astounding array of peculiar bananas, its giant seafood section offering more variety than many a municipal aquarium. If you live in a town without a full-service Asian market, this is a great place to stock up on teas, sauces, cooking pastes and sake, not to mention sinus-clearing instant ramen and powdered Vietnamese iced coffee, two items to which I have recently become addicted. Houston's Chinatown is relatively lacking in postcard-worthy vistas, but one exception is the Vietnamese Buddhist Teo Chew Temple (10599 Turtlewood Ct.). Seen in the middle distance from Bellaire Boulevard and across sluggish Brays Bayou, its traditional appearance coupled with the steamy landscape sweeps viewers away to southeast Asia. It's open to the public, and after you drive past a typical 1970s apartment complex, its incense-redolent air, serene atmosphere and ornate shrines to both bodhisatvas and ancestors (many of the latter adorned with offerings of fruit, takeaway lunches, or mini-bottles of liquor) sweep you deeper still into the heart of Vietnam, right here in the Lone Star State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-03T14:56:24.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

We live in California and I am contemplating divorce. I am 62 and he is 65. When we married, he owned a home (with a mortgage) purchased five years prior. A few years into our marriage, when interest rates fell, he refinanced the home. A couple of days before submitting the application, he asked me to sign an inter-spousal transfer of ownership (known as a quitclaim).\nThe reason: He said I had a student loan which had at one time been in default and we would not be able to receive a good interest rate, or that the loan might be altogether denied. He promised that as soon as the loan was approved, he would follow up by putting me back on title.\nDon?t miss: My wife gives our wayward son $25,000 a year ? what should I do?\nA few weeks later, we purchased a second home (cabin). Just a few minutes before going in to finalize the purchase, he asked to sign another quitclaim, citing the same circumstances. The mortgage on the cabin is underwater at this time.\nIt has been 14 years since this happened, and he refuses to add me to the title. He finally admitted that he indeed had an ulterior motive, as he witnessed a friend who underwent a divorce and lost a house to his former spouse and that he was not going to be ?taken advantage of? if we divorced.\nWhat are my options? I feel that I was deceived and that this constitutes fraud. About 90% of his investments were made before we were married, and I am also aware that he has made no provisions for me in his will nor named me as a beneficiary to his life insurance.\nBeverly in California\nDear Beverly,\nThe investments he had prior to your marriage belong to your husband and he is free to name anyone from the next-door neighbor to the window cleaner on his life insurance. Now, the good news:\nCalifornia ? in addition to Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico and Washington ? treat all marital assets as community property. That means that assets acquired during the marriage are divided equally between the two spouses. ?Notwithstanding an agreement otherwise, upon the death of a married person, one-half of the community property belongs to the surviving spouse and the other half belongs to the decedent,? according to California Probate Code Section 100(a). Why is that important to you? Because the refinancing of this home and the purchase of the cabin were made during your marriage, so it?s irrelevant whether your husband had you sign a quitclaim or not.\nRead: I will disinherit my daughter if she marries this man\nWell, not quite. A judge could look unfavorably on your husband?s behavior and your testimony (if you don?t have it in an email) that your husband did this because he wanted to prevent you from even owning the property you both bought during your marriage. There is a precedent for this: In 1996, a California woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later without even telling her husband or anyone else about her windfall. A couple of years later her husband discovered her deception and sued. Superior Court Judge Richard Denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. A judge could, in theory, take a similar view and punish your husband.\nYour husband?s shady behavior could end up doing him more harm than good in any divorce settlement. There are a lot of good, honest people out there waiting for you post-divorce.\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

Washington: As President-elect Donald Trump threatened to \"terminate\" the detente policy with Cuba, the White House today warned that reversing historic rapprochement would have \"significant\" diplomatic, economic and cultural costs.The policy is considered as one of the foreign policy legacies of outgoing President Barack Obama.Trump yesterday threatened in a tweet to put an end to the detente policy.\"If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the US as a whole, I will terminate deal,\" Trump said in a tweet.Trump's tweet landed just as Cuba began its week-long farewell to its former leader Fidel Castro.The White House, however, was quick to warn that there are costs involved for cancelling such an agreement with Cuba, under which the two countries not only reestablished their diplomatic relationship after decades, but also resumed flights and lifted several sanctions.\"I don't think I'm gonna be in a position of predicting the future. I think what I'm merely highlighting and trying to underscore here in as much detail as possible, is that it's just not as simple as one tweet might make it seem,\" the White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at his daily news conference.Earnest said that reversing the policy would be \"a significant economic blow\" to Cubans and was \"not as easy as a stroke of a pen\".\"That's just an objective fact when you consider how the American people and US businesses have implemented this deal in a way that has provided significant benefits to the American people and provided significant benefits to the Cuban people,\" he said.\"All of that would be undone by the reinstitution of a policy that has failed after having been in place for more than five decades. There are significant diplomatic, economic, cultural costs that will have to be accounted for if this policy is rolled back. This is among the many significant challenges that the incoming administration will have to carefully consider,\" Earnest said.After realising that the five decades old policy was not working, Obama two years ago announced to begin normalising relations between the two countries.\"This was rooted in the President's conclusion that a policy of isolation that the US had pursued for more than five decades had failed to bring about the improved human rights climate that I think just about every American citizen would like to see in Cuba. And after five decades of trying the same policy of isolation without seeing many results, the president believed it was time to try something different,\" he said.The new Cuba policy has benefited the American people in a tangible way and it continues to be strongly supported by an overwhelming majority of Cubans when they're asked about their opinion of this change in our policy.\"It's something that was very warmly welcomed by the Cuban people and I think that should be a pretty good indication of the kind of success that this policy is already having,\" Earnest said.Earlier in the morning, the Trump Transition Team communications director Jason Miller said though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Castro cannot be erased, the Trump Administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.Miller said Cuba is a very complex topic and the president-elect is aware of the nuances and complexities regarding the challenges that Ireland and the Cuban people face.\"So this will be an issue that he addresses once he becomes president, but I wouldn't qualify it as far as changing up or down. I'd say this has been an important issue, it will continue to be one, and to be clear, the president-elect wants to see freedom in Cuba for the Cubans and a good deal for Americans where we aren't played for fools,\" he said.\"Our priorities are the release of political prisoners, return of fugitives from American law, and also political and religious freedoms for all Cubans living in oppression,\" Miller told reporters during a conference call.

Experts on government ethics are warning President-elect Donald Trump that he?ll never shake suspicions of a clash between his private interests and the public good if he doesn?t sell off his vast holdings, which include roughly 500 companies in more than a dozen countries. They say just the appearance of conflicts is likely to tie up the new administration in investigations, lawsuits and squabbles. Photo by PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS/AP \nWASHINGTON ? President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he?s leaving his business empire to focus on being the nation?s 45th president, bowing to pressure to avoid potential conflicts of interest between governing and profiting in the private sector. \n?I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to make America great again,? he tweeted in a series of missives sent before dawn. ?While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.? \nHe said legal documents are ?being crafted which take me completely out of business operations,? he added, saying the presidency is ?a far more important task!? ADVERTISEMENT \nMeanwhile, former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin, Trump?s former campaign finance director, confirmed that Trump has picked him as treasury secretary and that billionaire investor Wilbur Ross has been chosen for commerce secretary. \nMnuchin, 53, led Trump?s finance operations during the presidential campaign. But he has no government experience, which could prove a political hurdle. If confirmed by the Senate, Mnuchin would play a central role in shaping Trump?s tax policies and infrastructure plans. He would also lead an agency tasked with implementing international economic sanctions. \nTrump has previously said that he?d leave his business operations to his three eldest children ? Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, though that wasn?t clear from his tweets Wednesday. \nReince Priebus, Trump?s incoming White House chief of staff, said Wednesday ?that?ll all be worked out.? \nPriebus told MSNBC?s Morning Joe , that Trump has ?got the best people in America working on it.? Priebus demurred when asked if Trump planned to put his businesses in a blind trust ? as presidents have traditionally done ? or leave them in his children?s hands. \n?I?m not ready to reveal that really,? Priebus said. \nPriebus added that Trump?s business acumen and the many business interests he has as a result of it is ?nothing to be ashamed about.? He said Trump is ?taking seriously? the issue of possible conflicts of interest. \n?We?re making sure that all those conflicts are taken care of,? Priebus said. He said the applicable rules and regulations ?are very vague? and that?s Trump?s people are ?doing the best job we can.? \nPriebus said the country hasn?t seen a president of such business acumen before and that the rules and regulations ?don?t contemplate this scenario.? \nMnuchin, meanwhile, told CNBC on Wednesday that he and Ross are ?thrilled to work for the president-elect and honored to have these positions.? He said ?sustained economic growth? is the chief priority of the incoming administration and that ?we can absolutely get to sustained 3 to 4 percent? in the gross domestic product. \nHe also outlined what he called ?the largest tax change? since President Ronald Reagan ? cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, a ?big? middle-class income tax cut and simplifying taxes. \n?By cutting corporate taxes, we?re going to create huge economic growth and we?ll have huge personal income,? Mnuchin told CNBC?s Squawk Box . \nNo previous commander in chief has brought with him such a sprawling business empire with so much complexity, opaqueness and opportunity for self-dealing as Trump. \nTrump owns golf clubs, office towers and other properties in several countries. He holds ownership stakes in more than 500 companies. He has struck licensing deals for use of his name on hotels and other buildings around the world and has been landing new business in the Middle East, India and South America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-30T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-30T16:13:33.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

Press Trust of India | Last Updated: November 04, 2016 15:40 (IST) Press Trust of India EMAIL COMMENTS Tata Sons has announced the organisational changes with immediate effect. Mumbai: Over a week after Cyrus Mistry was ousted as Chairman, Tata Sons today announced organisational changes bringing in S Padmanabhan as the group human resources head.Besides, the former Tata brand custodian under Mr Mistry's regime Mukund Rajan has been given the responsibility of overseeing operations of the overseas representative offices of Tata Sons in the USA, Singapore, Dubai and China.This is in addition to his existing responsibility of ethics and sustainability. Harish Bhat, who is responsible for marketing and customer centricity, will henceforth also be responsible for managing the Tata Brand, Tata Sons said in a statement.\"In the interim, he will oversee the functions of Strategy and Business Development,\" it added.Mr Padmanabhan has been given the responsibility of Group Human Resources in addition to his existing role of leading the Tata Business Excellence Group.Tata Sons further said Gopichand Katragadda will continue to be the Group Chief Technology Officer, while Sanjay Singh will oversee the Public Affairs function out of the Delhi office.Three members of the now-disbanded Group Executive Council set up by Mistry -- Nirmalya Kumar, N S Rajan and Madhu Kannan -- have already quit.They have decided to explore options outside Tata Sons and have left the services of the company, the statement added.On October 24, Tata Sons board had replaced Mr Mistry as Chairman and appointed Ratan Tata as interim Chairman. The company had said it would find a new Chairman in four months.Since then, a war of words has been going on between the Tatas and Mr Mistry, who alleged that he was pushed into a position of \"lame duck\" chairman and changes in decision making process created alternate power centres in Tata Group.Tata retorted saying Mr Mistry's removal was \"absolutely necessary\" for the future success of the Tata Group and insisted that the decision was a well-considered and serious one for its board members.

Ratings Steady, ?Once Upon A Time? Ticks Up Nellie Andreeva Pin it Share The Sunday Night Football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos averaged an 11.8 rating/20 share from 8:30 PM-12:30 AM ET in the metered market households. That was off by a tenth of a rating point and up a notch in the share from the previous SNF game between the Green Bay Packers and the Washington Redskins (11.9/19). Last night?s result was on the higher end of SNF metered market deliveries in what has been a rough fall for NFL football on TV. The Chiefs? overtime win in Denver topped both the last Chiefs SNF game (11.0/18 vs. Pittsburgh on October 2, 2016) and the last Broncos SNF game (11.7/19 vs. Oakland on November 6, 2016). In the non-time zone adjusted fast nationals, SNF was up week-to-week by 0.2 in adults 18-49. ABC?s Quantico (0.7) was flat week-to-week in its fall finale. It?s been a tough start of the second season for the terrorism drama after a breakout fall 2015 run ? it drew a 0.6-0.7 adults 18-49 Live+same day ratings for its five most recent episodes. Despite solid DVR bumps, that is too small of a base to go off of. ABC is throwing the sophomore drama a lifeline with a scheduling upgrade. Quantico will move to Mondays after the winter break, taking over the 10 PM slot from freshman Conviction, w hich did not get a back order . ( The fate of any remaining Conviction originals is TBD.) Quantico , which like the new season of Homeland features a female US president, will benefit from a stronger lead-in from Dancing with the Stars on Monday. On Sunday, it was preceded by Secrets & Lies (0.7, even with last week). At 8 PM, Once Upon a Time (1.0) recovered a bit from the all-time low two weeks ago with a 0.1 uptick. CBS? Sunday lineup was delayed by 49 minutes following NFL coverage. Rough initial estimates have NCIS: Los Angeles at 1.4, Madam Secretary at 0.9 and Elementary ( from 11-11:30 PM) at 0.6. All numbers are off by a tenth from last Sunday, with NCIS: LA poised to again rank as the top scripted program on Sunday. Fox?s lone original was Bob?s Burgers (1.1). NBC is projected to win the night in all key measures.

Her husband, Michelle realizes now, was into some sketchy stuff, stuff that would eventually land him in jail. Things worsened when Michelle lost her job, a consequence of being unable to find affordable child care. Emotional abuse at the hands of her husband turned into physical abuse.\n?You never see those relationships end well,? Michelle said. ?When push comes to shove, I have to be alive and well for my children. .?.?. I didn?t have a plan, per se. I packed up what I could, and we just left.?\nA year earlier, Michelle had attended a church conference where she?d befriended a woman who lived in Northern Virginia. That?s where she headed, to the only sympathetic home she could think of. Her friend could accommodate Michelle and her children for only a short while, so the family found itself homeless.\nMichelle said the 41 days they spent living in a Fairfax County homeless shelter disabused her of the notion that she was in control of her life.\n?I was someone who was like, ?I?m supermom, and I can do it all,? Michelle said.\nEven in the shelter, she worked. She found a job at a post office 50 miles away. She was homeless, barely treading water, deeply in debt, commuting 100 miles a day. Her daughter was distraught that she?d started high school while living in a shelter.\n?I cried on my way to work every morning and on my way home every night,? Michelle said.\nThen Michelle heard about Homestretch, a charity that works with homeless families in Virginia and is a partner in The Washington Post Helping Hand . More than 90 percent of the families Homestretch serves are headed by single mothers. Sixty percent are homeless because of domestic violence or human trafficking.\n?The interview process was about three hours long,? Michelle said. ?If you got accepted, you had to come back for another 2?-hour interview. .?.?. They talked about how they want to help you and also how they want you to help yourself.?\nHomestretch advisers sat down with Michelle and explained that they would provide an apartment for her family. She would be required to pay 30 percent of her salary in rent and put an additional 10 percent of her salary into a savings account to start paying back the debt she had accrued when her marriage was falling apart.\nShe would also need to participate in financial counseling, employment counseling and life-skills counseling.\n?All of those resources are tied into one another,? Michelle said.\nMichelle was impressed that the Homestretch employment counselor urged her not to jump into the first job she could find close to home. It was important that Michelle find a job that suited her skills, paid well and came with longevity.\n?With longevity comes a better salary,? Michelle said.\nThat?s what Michelle found: an administrative office job that pays $52,000 a year.\nFor the first time ever, Michelle has life insurance, purchased with the help of Homestretch. ?I look at my credit report every day,? she said. ?That?s something I?ve never done before. Even though I worked in banking, I?ve never done it.?\nMichelle is halfway through the two-year Homestretch program.\n?My hope for a year from now is to be completely debt-free and also to purchase a home in Virginia,? she said. ?When you purchase a house, it?s like saying we?re here for the long haul. It?s a safe place. These doors will never be closed. It?s home.?\nYou can help Michelle told me that becoming part of Homestretch was like ?hitting the reset button.? It?s given her a safe space in which to get her life in order. (She?s not the only one in the family working. Her teenage daughter is, too.)\nYour tax-deductible gift to Homestretch will help other families in need. To give online, visit posthelpinghand.com .

A suburban Salt Lake City police officer was killed Sunday when authorities say he was struck by people fleeing in a stolen vehicle.\nWest Valley City police Officer Cody Brotherson was deploying tire spikes when he was hit, authorities said. He is the first officer to die in the line of duty since the department formed in 1980.\n\"A West Valley born and bred individual and our hearts are heavy with his loss,\" Police Chief Lee Russo said at a news conference just hours after the officer's death.\nAccording to Russo, it was not clear why the 25-year-old officer was outside his vehicle since spike strips had already been deployed before he was hit.\n\"He was certainly responding to the coordinated effort in stopping this vehicle,\" Russo said.\nHowever, the chief said it was not yet clear if the suspects deliberately hit Brotherson.\nBrotherson joined the department in December 2013. He is survived by a fiance, his parents and two brothers.\nDozens of officers saluted as his body was loaded into a hearse, which was escorted by police cars to the state medical examiner's office.\nThe incident began around 3:30 a.m. when an officer noticed a suspicious vehicle. Officers then witnessed three people in the car steal another vehicle from the parking lot of an apartment complex, police said. They tried to stop the vehicle but the suspects fled, leading to a pursuit.\nLess than a minute later, an officer called for medical help for Brotherson. He died at the scene.\nAfter hitting Brotherson, the vehicle went off the road and came to rest a short distance away.\nAll three people in the stolen vehicle were taken into custody. They are still being questioned, police said. Their identities were not released.\nAnother Salt Lake City-area police department will now lead the investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-07T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-07T00:56:23.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

Here?s a breakdown of notable early-voting stats:\n?Roughly half of Florida?s 12.9 million registered voters cast their ballots early, up 80 percent from 2012.\n?Early votes cast by Latinos were up 108 percent compared to 2008.\n?Democrats have the edge by approximately 87,000 ballots. Democrat Floridians cast almost 2.6 million votes, compared to almost 2.5 million for Republicans. But the Tampa Bay Times observed that the Dems? early-voting lead this time falls short of the 100,000 they had in the 2012 race.\n?As of Saturday, 36 percent of the Latinos who voted early did not vote at all in the 2012 election, according to political scientist Daniel Smith from the University of Florida.\n?About 455,000 Latinos voted early in Florida ? 86.9 percent more than in 2012.\n?More than 70,000 African-American Floridians voted early, a 9.2 percent increase over 2012.\n?The surge was driven in part by two large southern Florida counties in the final days of early voting: In Miami-Dade, 55 percent voted early, and in Broward, 52 percent, which the Tampa Bay Times noted was above the statewide average. ?There?s really no other way to say it,? said politics writer Patricia Mazzei in the Miami Herald. ?Early voting went absolutely gangbusters in Florida?s two most populous counties on Sunday.?\n?As of 3:10 p.m. Monday, FiveThirtyEight put Hillary Clinton?s chances of winning the swing state at 51.4 percent, a more than three-percentage-point increase from Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/home/?status=6.4", "https://countyballotfiles.elections.myflorida.com/FVRSCountyBallotReports/AbsenteeEarlyVotingReports/PublicStats", "http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/florida-leads-nation-in-64-million-ballots-cast-before-election-day/2301769", "http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/florida/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2F6-4-million-floridians-have-already-voted-more-than-the-states-entire-turnout-in-2000", "http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm", "https://electionsmith.wordpress.com/2016/11/07/cannibals-all/"], "published": "2016-11-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-08T00:01:36.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

SILVA). \nPru Life UK eyes lower to middle class sector to grow insurance market \nA life insurance company is aiming to increase the insurance penetration in the country and lessen the $372 billion insurance protection gap through the lower to middle income class market. \nPru Life UK aims to increase the insurance penetration in the country which currently stands at less than two percent of the country?s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and decrease the insurance protection gap or the value of insurance Filipinos should have but don?t, which is currently at $372 billion, said Pru Life UK Senior Vice President and Chief Agency Officer Maria Divina Furagganan during the product launch at Radisson Blu Hotel in Cebu City. The insurance industry is valued at P100 billion at present, but if the country?s protection gap is met, premiums of around P600 billion may be generated annually. ADVERTISEMENT \nFuragganan said the protection gap exists because the industry is not focused on selling protection products while issues on financial literacy also need to be addressed. \n?We need to educate Filipinos on the need to save and protect their income. Just relying on savings is not enough. The bottomline here is education and financial literacy,? she said. \nFuragganan said they intend to get a share of the lower and middle income class market through their newest product, PRUmax invest, a life insurance product which would meet the needs of the Filipinos, ?whatever their stage of life? may be. \nShe said the company?s newest offering integrates the best features of traditional and unit-linked insurance products, providing comprehensive protection coverage at the same time allowing policy holders to accumulate wealth. \n11% market share \nAs of 2015, Pru Life UK holds an 11 percent market share translating to more than 200,000 premium holders across the whole country. \nWith the launch of their newest product, Furagganan said they hope to increase the number of their policy holders by 20 percent each year. \nOne of the company?s biggest districts is in Cebu, with over eight branches and manpower of 1,500, contributing 13 percent to the firm?s total production and increasing year after year. \nPRUmax invest \nAimee dela Cruz, assistant vice president for pricing and product development, said PRUmax invest specifically targets professionals who are just starting their career, business process outsourcing employees, newly weds, and accomplished professionals targeting early retirement. \n?PRUmax invest is a 15-year renewable term plan which provides comprehensive protection coverage through the base traditional plan while also allowing the opportunity for wealth accumulation by investing in various funds through the Variable Life Rider,? she said. \nFor premium as low as P12,000 annually, policy holders can avail of a P1-million coverage and the product?s investment component under the base plan. \nAside from insurance protection, Dela Cruz said product benefits include several rider options, a choice of funds for investment, partial withdrawals, and fund switching, among others. \nIn April this year, Pru Life UK introduced Elite Protector 5 (Elite 5), a similar product but for the upper middle class market. \nAntonio Garces II, vice president for investments, said the Variable Life Rider provides policy holders with the flexibility to choose where to invest their premiums from among the company?s extensive fund portfolio for a minimum annual premium of P5,000. \nHe said that while there are mutual funds and unit investment trust funds, this is another alternative that will cater to small investors. \nPRUlink funds \nPRUlink funds are invested in a diversified portfolio of assets managed by Eastspring Investments, the Asian asset management arm of Prudential plc, Pru Life UK?s mother company. \nEastspring Investments has been managing the underlying funds of Pru Life UK?s unit-linked life insurance products in the Philippines since 2002. \nThe launch of Pru Life UK?s newest product coincides with the company?s 20th anniversary in the Philippines. \nAt present, the company has expanded its reach to over 80 branches in the country, with the biggest life agency force of 14,000 licensed agents, and has emerged as one of the top five life insurers.

While King George III was singing, ?Oceans rise, empires fall / We have seen each other through it all?, across the ocean, Britain was voting to leave the European Union. When Hamilton: The Musical brings its story of the American revolution to London next year, its certain triumph is going to create all kinds of historical ironies.\nSixteen ways Hamilton transformed theater ? and the world Read more\nHamilton is the kind of transformative theatrical experience that has only happened a few times in the history of American musicals. It joins the likes of Show Boat , Oklahoma! and West Side Story as game changers, innovative productions that forever redefined what came after them. Unlike most of its predecessors, however, Hamilton was created by one man, Lin?Manuel Miranda, who wrote the music, lyrics, and book about the musical (only Stephen Sondheim can claim as much, and none of his shows were such blockbusters). Hamilton fuses American history with current politics, using a soundtrack of American popular music and one of the most inventive librettos ever written. The result is that nearly every song in the show works as a complex historical concert, layering musical pasts with the musical present, just as the historical past mingles with the political present. In less than two years, it has exploded all box office records ? it has sold $1bn worth of tickets ? and won every theatrical prize (including the Pulitzer prize for drama), garnering the kind of hyperbolic praise that no production can possibly live up to. But Hamilton exceeds its own acclaim.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phillipa Soo as Eliza and Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton. Photograph: Joan Marcus\nMiranda had already created a successful musical ( In the Heights ) when he impulsively decided to read Ron Chernow?s prize-winning biography Alexander Hamilton on holiday (Miranda?s whim has made Chernow, who reportedly gets 1% of Hamilton?s profit, a very wealthy man). Hamilton represents something of an anomaly in American history, a founding father who never transferred from official histories into popular mythology. There are many reasons for this, not least that Hamilton?s positions were incompatible with many of our myths ? he was avowedly elitist, for example, and supported the idea of a president for life ? while his expansion of the federal government prompted the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, which he brutally suppressed. Neither of these facts makes it into Miranda?s musical, which is the story of a ?young, scrappy and hungry? immigrant from the West Indies who became the quintessential American success story through a combination of brains, hard work and audacity. Miranda creates a myth for Hamilton by celebrating him as a symbol of immigrant inclusiveness, egalitarianism and meritocracy: historically it?s a stretch, but theatrically it?s genius.\nEventually Hamilton became a hero of the American revolution, George Washington?s right-hand man, the nation?s first secretary of the treasury, the co-author (with James Madison) of The Federalist Papers , and the primary proponent for federal government over state government. He argued for a national bank, created the national reserve as well as the national debt, and laid the foundations for the US?s economic success. His dramatic life came to a melodramatic end when he was killed in a duel by the sitting vice president, Aaron Burr. And yet, despite all these achievements and dramas, Hamilton has been marginalised by most popular accounts of American history. Washington , Jefferson, John Adams have been the subject of countless books, films, miniseries and even their own popular musical, 1776 . But 1776 , which tells the story of the battle over writing the Declaration of Independence, does not even mention Hamilton.\nThat sidelining resonated with Miranda, himself the son of Puerto Rican immigrants, as an emblematic instance of the nation?s treatment of immigrants, both as individuals and as a collective part of the nation?s history. Those twin intuitions sparked a musical about historical, cultural and political inclusion, in which an almost entirely non-white cast plays the founding fathers (and a few of the mothers, although the cast is also overwhelmingly male). The result is the most unexpected of phenomena: a Broadway hit that is about political, economic and racial history while also offering an implicit but acidic running commentary on the racial and cultural politics of the US today. Everything about the show is ?meta?, as layered references compound meaning like interest: Hamilton is metatheatrical, metahistorical, metamusical, metamorphic.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonathan Groff as George III. Photograph: Joan Marcus\nMuch has been written about Miranda?s wide-ranging but acute musical references, from a Britpop-inflected George III (?When you?re gone, I?ll go mad / So don?t throw away this thing we had / Cause when push comes to shove / I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love?) to the three Schuyler sisters singing about New York in the manner of Destiny?s Child; from the Notorious BIG to Kander and Ebb. Miranda is conducting a magisterial conversation with musical theatre, which is a kind of microcosm of American popular history, marked in important ways by the mainstream?s appropriation of minority cultures ( Show Boat , West Side Story ). Hamilton reverses that process, exploring mainstream history through the music of subcultures. Lines about racism from Rodgers and Hammerstein?s South Pacific (?you?ve got to be carefully taught?) rub shoulders with Busta Rhymes; Sondheim?s experiments in perspective from Pacific Overtures meet Snoop Dogg . There is a running gag about Adams, in which Miranda riffs on 1776 ; its opening number is the resounding ?Sit Down, John!? in which the Continental Congress tells him to shut up. Miranda is doing the same, telling Adams and the Anglocentric American history he embodies to step aside. He sidelines Adams, waiting until the second act to mention him, and then has Hamilton sing, ?Sit down, John, you fat motherfucker!? Less explicit (in every sense) is Miranda?s decision to give Hamilton a signature refrain ? ?I will never be satisfied? ? that echoes Adams?s line from 1776 , ?I have always been dissatisfied, I know that.?\nMiranda?s lyrics are dizzying: he rhymes Socrates with mediocrities, before linking manumission, abolition and ammunition. Gilbert and Sullivan are not only sampled, they are schooled; Miranda gleefully told a journalist he felt he?d improved the rhyme in Gilbert?s famous patter, which becomes George Washington?s rap: ?Now I?m the model of a modern major general / The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all / Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal.? Puns abound with the exuberant energy of a word-drunk writer: ?Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance / They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence.?\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daveed Diggs in Hamilton. Photograph: Joan Marcus\nAlmost all of Hamilton is sung through, as opera: there is very little spoken dialogue, and much less rap than some accounts might suggest. When rap comes in, it is with ?practical tactical brilliance?, as when Miranda turns cabinet debates into rap battles, in which Jefferson and Hamilton face off and drop the mic, in reference to Eminem?s 8 Mile . Hamilton and Burr?s fatal duel is likened to gang violence by sampling the legendary ?Ten Crack Commandments? by Notorious BIG, himself notoriously the victim of gang violence. ?It must be nice to have Washington on your side,? sung by Burr, Jefferson and Madison, is ostensibly about President Washington?s patronage of Hamilton, but it also becomes about modern disenfranchisement, alienated citizens who feel that Washington DC is not on their side. A song called ?Wait for It? is about Burr?s character, but it is also about ? wait for it ? how destructive it has been for communities of colour to be told to wait their turn.\nAs with the lyrics, the music is used to make historical points, rather than simply to score points. Jefferson and Burr each have a standout solo in the second act. (Miranda is markedly generous, giving his co-stars most of the best songs.) Returning from Paris, Jefferson sings ? What?d I Miss? ? over boogie-woogie piano with riffs on other Dixieland jazz sounds, including stride and ragtime. Its invocations of the origins of jazz as the kind of grandfather of rap are at once facetious ? as performed by Daveed Diggs, Jefferson even uses ?jazz hands? ? and serious. Because Jefferson was considerably older than Hamilton and his contemporaries, Miranda gives the younger characters hip-hop influences, while Jefferson sings old-school jazz, which also lets Miranda tip his hat to classic performers such as Cab Calloway, whose vocals pointed the way to rap. As the act progresses, Jefferson?s influence on Burr deepens. By the time Burr breaks out into his great second act number, ?The Room Where It Happens?, his musical style has subtly shifted, as he picks up Jefferson?s Dixieland jazz. Burr?s song is the kind of gospel-inspired, choir-backed showstopper that composers have used for more than a century in American musical theatre to get audiences on their feet, from Cole Porter?s ?Blow, Gabriel, Blow? to Frank Loesser?s ?Sit Down, You?re Rockin? the Boat?. But unlike those songs, which are great fun but almost entirely meaningless, ?The Room Where It Happens? is a foot-stomping, barnstorming, surge-to-your feet instant classic about ? the historical record.\nIt?s a turning point in the show in many senses: Burr stops waiting for it, and the gaps in the historical record become a metaphor for political exclusion. ?The Room Where It Happens? is about the way in which historiography constructs mythologies of power, and it?s about realpolitik, how politics gets done. Burr sings, ?No one really knows how the / Parties get to yes / The pieces that are sacrificed in / Ev?ry game of chess / We just assume that it happens / But no one else is in / The room where it happens?, before launching into his power verse: ?I wanna be in / The room where it happens / The room where it happens.?\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Jackson as George Washington. Photograph: Joan Marcus\nMiranda is putting immigrants and the descendants of slaves, black people, Latinos and Asians, low-income kids with little hope for the future, in the room where it happens. The ambitious individual left out of the ?smoke-filled room? becomes the emblem of entire groups excluded from power. ?We want our leaders to save the day ? / But we don?t get a say in what they trade away / We dream of a brand new start ? / But we dream in the dark for the most part.? The song encapsulates the entire musical, which continually raises questions of historiography and the power to shape a national narrative. Hamilton?s wife, Eliza, initially wants to take her place in history ? ?Oh, let me be a part of the narrative / In the story they will write someday? ? but when Hamilton betrays her, she burns their letters, to control the narrative. And then in the end, when Hamilton has died far too young, Eliza sings, ?I put myself back in the narrative?. Miranda returns in closing to the question of competing historical versions in a song in which Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Eliza all admit that what matters is, ?Who lives, who dies, who tells your story? Will they tell your story? ? Who tells your story??\nHamilton's teenage superfans: 'This is, like, crazy cool' Read more\nThe question of what gets left out of the narrative is one that can also be asked of Hamilton ?s own mythmaking, however. Although Miranda invokes popular histories to accuse them of colour blindness, the fact is that even 1776 confronted the question of slavery far more directly back in 1969 than Hamilton does today. To be sure, 1776 features an all-white cast arguing about whether slavery is bad; Jefferson terribly misses his terribly blond wife and can?t write the Declaration of Independence until she joins him, while his slave Sally Hemings, who probably mothered six of his children, is never mentioned. But 1776 also ends on ?Molasses to Rum?, a startlingly frank and brutal account of the triangle trade, and an indictment of the north?s hypocrisy about slavery. Hamilton does mention Hemings ? once ? and has some other references to slavery, but strongly implies that only Jefferson owned slaves, while suggesting that Hamilton was a far more dedicated abolitionist than the record shows. In fact, Washington and Madison also owned slaves, while Hamilton bought and sold slaves for his wife?s family, and was inconsistent in regards to manumission.\nHamilton features black and brown actors, but its story never depicts a slave. That said, it?s also true that minstrelsy is crucial to Miranda?s project: he takes the long American minstrelsy tradition of white people in blackface on stage and reverses it. He appropriates its music, rewrites its lyrics, turns its politics on its head, and fashions the whole thing into a show that is simultaneously an excoriation of current American political realities, an encomium to American revolutionary energies, and a celebration of American musical theatre history. If you live in Britain, you will have to wait until next November for it, but when it comes, believe me, you?ve gotta be in the room where it happens.\n?

The Latest developments on Election Day in Wisconsin (all times local): 11:45 p.m. Republicans have not only retained control of the Wisconsin Senate , but they look like they're going to knock out three Democratic incumbents. Republican challengers were leading Democratic incumbents Julie Lassa of Stevens Point, Dave Hansen of Green Bay and Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse late Tuesday. Three GOP incumbents won their seats and a Republican won an open seat representing the Fond du Lac area to secure a Republican majority in the chamber for another two years. ___ 10:45 p.m. Russ Feingold says in the wake of his defeat that \"this could be one of the most challenging times in the history of the country.\" Feingold delivered the dour message after losing to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin's U.S. Senate race. Polls had shown Feingold ahead the entire race, but Johnson closed the gap in the waning days. Feingold was trying to avenge a 2010 loss to Johnson. Feingold tells his supporters that they should \"be as restrained as you can be.\" Johnson says that he intends to concentrate on areas of agreement with Democrats as he sets off on his second term. ___ 10:40 p.m. Republicans have retained control of the Wisconsin state Senate, setting the stage for the GOP to maintain complete control of state government. The GOP entered Tuesday's election with an 18-14 advantage with one open seat. Democrats needed to win six of the eight seats in play to get to a 17-member majority. Republicans needed to win only four. GOP incumbents Robert Cowles of Green Bay, Sheila Harsdorf of River Falls, Tom Tiffany of Little Rice all won. Republican newcomer Daniel Feyen won an open seat representing the Fond du Lac area to give the GOP 17 seats. Republicans were widely expected to maintain their majority in the Assembly as well. Republicans have controlled both legislative houses and the governor's office since 2011. With Gov. Scott Walker not up for re-election until 2018, Republicans will have complete control of state government for another two years. ___ 10:30 p.m. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson tells The Associated Press he defeated Democrat Russ Feingold because \"I told the truth.\" Johnson tells AP in a telephone interview from Oshkosh that \"I think the good folks of Wisconsin recognized that. Johnson says his win shows people are concerned about the direction of the country. He says, \"They are not happy with what's happened in Washington, D.C. They see a dysfunctional system.\" Johnson says he will be working with Gov. Scott Walker and national Republican leaders on a coordinated agenda \"so we really can bring the type of change that voters have asked for now.\" Johnson is the first Republican to win election to the Senate in a presidential year since 1980. ___ 10:25 p.m. Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has won re-election, beating Democrat Russ Feingold in Wisconsin. Johnson's victory Tuesday came in a rematch of the 2010 race in which Johnson ended Feingold's 18-year run in the Senate. Democrats pegged Johnson to be vulnerable and eyed the seat as one they could pick up in their attempts to regain majority control of the Senate. They were wrong. Johnson argued that Feingold had already been fired by voters once six years ago and had done nothing to warrant returning to the Senate. Feingold tried to make an issue of Johnson supporting Donald Trump for president as he argued the former manufacturer had been an ineffective. ___ 10 p.m. Republican Mike Gallagher has defeated Democrat Tom Nelson in the race for an open congressional seat representing northeastern Wisconsin. Gallagher is a former Marine from Green Bay who served as national security adviser on Gov. Scott Walker's short-lived presidential campaign last year. Nelson, a former state legislator from Appleton, currently serves as Outagamie County executive. Gallagher will represent Wisconsin's 8th Congressional District, which includes Marinette, Brown, Kewaunee, Door, Calumet, Outagamie, Waupaca, Menominee and Oconto counties. He replaces Republican three-term incumbent Reid Ribble , who announced in January that he wouldn't seek re-election. ___ 9:35 p.m. Republican Mike Gallagher has opened a sizable lead on Democrat Tom Nelson in the race for northeastern Wisconsin's open congressional seat. According to returns tabulated by The Associated Press, Gallagher was leading Nelson by about 65 percentage points with a little less than a quarter of the expected vote counted in the 8th Congressional District. The district includes a large chunk of northeastern Wisconsin, including Green Bay, Appleton and Marinette. The district has swung between Republican and Democratic control over the last two decades. Gallagher and Nelson are vying to replace Republican incumbent Reid Ribble, who announced in January he wouldn't seek a fourth term. ___ 9:10 p.m. Republican Dan Feyen has won an open seat in the Wisconsin state Senate, dashing Democratic hopes of picking up a district they had targeted. Feyen beat Democrat Mark Harris in the 18th Senate District that includes parts of Winnebago and Fond du Lac counties. Democrats had high hopes of winning the seat after incumbent Republican Rick Gudex announced last year that he wouldn't seek re-election. Republicans passed a law this past session designed to drive Harris, the Winnebago County executive, out of the race. The law prohibits county executives from serving simultaneously in the Legislature. The measure would have forced Harris to trade his $102,834 county executive salary for a senator's $50,950 salary if he had won the race. ___ 8:45 p.m. The race for president and U.S. Senate in Wisconsin are too close to call based on early returns. Republicans Donald Trump and incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson both had narrow leads based on early returns. Democrat Russ Feingold is trying to defeat Johnson in a rematch of their 2010 race. And Democrat Hillary Clinton was so confident about her chances in Wisconsin she didn't even campaign in the state after the primary. That marked the first time since 1972 that one of the two major party candidates for president skipped the state in the general election campaign. Wisconsin has 10 electoral votes. ___ House Speaker Paul Ryan has won a ninth term in Congress. Ryan, a Janesville Republican, defeated challenger Ryan Solen , a Mt. Pleasant Democrat, in Tuesday's election. Ryan was first elected to represent southeastern Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District in 1998. He succeeded John Boehner as speaker last year. Ryan took pointed criticism from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump last month after Ryan told House members he would no longer defend or campaign for Trump. Ryan made the pledge after a tape surfaced of Trump making predatory remarks about women in 2005. __ 8 p.m. Polls are closed in Wisconsin, but people in line can still cast their ballots. Results will begin to roll in as counties report their totals in the presidential race, the contest for U.S. Senate and a host of other races for the state Legislature and local offices. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is running for re-election against Democrat Russ Feingold, a rematch of their 2010 race. Polls leading up to the election showed the race to be tight. ___ 7 p.m. Elections officials in Madison are giving voters at one polling place an extra hour to vote because of a fire alarm earlier in the day. City officials say the polls at East High School will remain open until 9 p.m. because of concerns that the alarm prevented some Ward 29 residents from voting. All other polling locations in Madison will close at 8 p.m., but voters who are in line at 8 p.m. will be allowed to cast their ballots. The extension is not expected to delay the reporting of election results elsewhere. ___ 5:30 p.m. Polling places ran out of ballots in part of Waukesha County in suburban Milwaukee, but officials say residents had other ways of voting and nobody was turned away. Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Novack says the shortage developed late morning in some precincts in the Town of Lisbon that have students in the Arrowhead School District. She says their best guess is that local voter interest in two ballot questions on facilities upgrades was overwhelming. New ballots were ordered around noon, and they arrived around 2:30 p.m. But Novack says nobody was denied the opportunity to vote. She says voters had the option of using a touch screen system, or filling out photocopied ballots that election judges would hand-copy later onto official ballots. The affected precincts have about 1,900 registered voters. ___ 2:45 p.m. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonnell says University of Wisconsin-Madison officials have come up with a clever way to ensure that the 14,000 students on campus from out-of-state can vote under Wisconsin's new voter ID law. McDonnell says UW-Madison's student ID cards don't comply with the law because they expire in five years, rather than two years as the law requires. So he says UW officials have set up tables at all campus polling stations where they're printing out paper voting-only IDs that let students vote. And McDonnell says they're getting heavy use. McDonnell says he thinks the two-year expiration dates were part of an effort to make it harder for students to vote. But he says the university found a \"clever way\" to manage the problem that's working out well. ___ 1:45 p.m. Stefani Berg is a 25-year-old nurse from Milwaukee who was one of many waiting until Election Day to cast her ballot. Berg says she been studying the candidates and voted for Hillary Clinton because she would be a stronger leader and is more closely aligned with her views on Supreme Court choices. Berg says Republican candidate Donald Trump \"acts a bit childish when it comes to trying to be a leader.\" She worries about how he would react to some important matters, including immigration and foreign policy and is concerned that foreign leaders may not respect him and in turn fail to respect the U.S. Berg is one of about 3 million Wisconsinites expected to vote in the general election. ____ 12:30 p.m. A Sun Prairie man is angry that he was turned away from the polls under Wisconsin's new voter ID requirements. Tony Harper says he's been a registered Wisconsin voter since 1982. But he says he wasn't allowed to vote even though he carried his Wisconsin driver's license and his U.S. passport ? proof of his Wisconsin residency and U.S. citizenship. He says he moved from Madison to Sun Prairie about a year and a half ago, but his license still shows his old address. He says officials told him his auto insurance bill wasn't sufficient proof of his new address. Harper, a middle-aged white man who wouldn't disclose his political leanings, says he plans to return after work with qualifying proof. But he says it's a big inconvenience for him and suspects it will be for other voters who work day shifts. ___ 11:30 a.m. Poll workers and other observers are reporting steady voting in Tuesday's general election in Wisconsin after an early morning crunch of people, some of whom waited in long lines for a chance to cast their ballot. One of Milwaukee's busier wards on the near north side blocks from Lake Michigan had nearly 400 voters by mid-morning. Chief inspector Shana Lucas says that's more votes that some elections draw during the whole day in that ward. Lines were long before the workday at Milwaukee's municipal building in downtown Milwaukee. State elections officials expect more than 3 million people will vote in this election in Wisconsin. ____ 7:55 a.m. The culmination of a tense political season ends Tuesday at the ballot box. So, it might be tempting to snap a selfie photo with your ballot after you're done voting. In Wisconsin, that would be problematic. Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney says the concern isn't so much with the photo itself, but in sharing that photo. Posting it on social media equates to showing your ballot to someone else ? and that's against the law. Magney tells WUWM-FM ( http://bit.ly/2eIFUsB ) the intent of the law is to prevent people from selling their votes. A review by The Associated Press shows there are laws against voters sharing any photo of their ballot in 18 states, while six others bar photography in polling places but allow photos of mail-in ballots. ____ 7:05 a.m. Polls are open in Wisconsin where voters weary of the political rhetoric have the final say on the person they want to be the next commander in chief and the next U.S. senator from the Badger State, as well as other choices. It's the first presidential election where voters here are required to show a photo ID before receiving their ballot. Wisconsin Election Commission officials predict turnout of near 70 percent, on par with the past two presidential elections where photo IDs were not required. Democrats hope to keep a presidential winning streak dating back to 1988 alive, while Republicans try to re-elect Sen. Ron Johnson, which would make him the first Wisconsin Republican to win a Senate seat in a presidential year since 1980. ____ 6:35 a.m. The majority of Wisconsin's eligible voters will head to the polls on this Election Day. Nearly 800,000 of the expected 3 million people who are expected to vote in the general election have already cast their ballots. That includes 28-year-old Rebecca Zbichorski (sbee-HOR'-skee) who headed to the municipal building in downtown Milwaukee to cast an early vote for Donald Trump. Zbirchorski spent nearly eight years on active duty in the Marines with two deployments to Iraq. She says \"America needs a kick in the behind\" and thinks Trump is the guy to do it. Zbirchorski says she's tired of the political chaos and hopes the outcome of Tuesday's presidential election won't be challenged. The Wisconsin Elections Commission projects nearly 70 percent of the state's eligible voters are expected to cast ballots in this election. ____ 12:16 a.m. Wisconsin Democrats are hoping to keep a presidential winning streak alive and avenge a loss that sent a former longtime senator packing six years ago. Republicans hope to make Donald Trump the first GOP presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan to win in Wisconsin. They also are working to send Sen. Ron Johnson back to the Senate in his rematch against former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold. Those two statewide races topped Wisconsin's ballot Tuesday. In northeast Wisconsin, the open 8th Congressional District saw Republican newcomer Mike Gallagher running against Democratic Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson.

"persons": [], "text": "Credit RSS | Wed Nov 9, 2016 | 6:09pm EST Trump victory clouds outlook for Time Warner-AT&T, other mergers By Diane Bartz and Olivia Oran | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK \nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK U.S. corporate dealmakers were likely to put major merger plans on hold as they assess whether President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his populist promises and a threat to block AT&T Inc's purchase of Time Warner Inc, or act more like traditional business-friendly Republicans. \nTrump's rhetoric and the personal nature of the campaign, which included little discussion of policy, left many uncertain about the new U.S. leader's plans, including how his administration will handle mega-mergers. \nWall Street braced for a drop in deals, with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday projecting a 20 to 30 percent downside for earnings of banks that focus on merger and acquisition advice, and Jefferies saying uncertainty about Trump's policy on trade, healthcare, taxes and energy could hamper underwriting activity and M&A globally. \n\"I think a lot of deals will hit the pause button for a bit until we get some clarity on whether President Trump will moderate or be as disruptive as some expect,\" said a senior Wall Street banker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media. \n\"It's going to be a tough environment for everything until we see how (Trump) behaves as a leader,\" the banker added. \nTrump said in October that AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio would put too much power in the hands of one company, and that he would block a deal. \nThe gap between Time Warner shares and the implied value of AT&T's cash and stock bid was over 23 percent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, compared with around 22 percent at Tuesday's close, indicating greater investor skepticism that the companies will be able to complete the transaction. \nIn addition to criticizing AT&T's deal with Time Warner, owner of CNN, Trump has said he would look to break up Comcast's deal to buy NBC Universal, which closed in 2013. He has also threatened antitrust action against Amazon, which owns the Washington Post. \nAll three news organizations have had spats with the president-elect, raising concern in Washington that Trump may use antitrust law to avenge personal slights, said an antitrust expert who asked not to be named to protect business relationships. \n\"That's a fear. That's a legitimate fear,\" added Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel, PLLC, who said presidents tended not to weigh in on specific decisions by antitrust enforcers. \n\"The last president to try to do that was Richard Nixon,\" said Bloom, referring to a Nixon attorney general, Richard Kleindienst, who was convicted of falsely testifying to Congress that the White House had not meddled with an antitrust probe of International Telephone and Telegraph Corp, according to Kleindienst's obituary in the New York Times. \nPOPULIST OR PRO-BUSINESS REPUBLICAN? \nStill, some investors believed the man who considers himself business friendly would take a more moderate tone once he assumes office in January. \n\"We think Trump will be pretty good for merger and acquisition activity. As a general proposition, he is pro-business and pro-free market,\" said Roy Behren, portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Management. \nOther big pending U.S. deals also did not see sharp changes in prices on Wednesday, and the spreads of three healthcare deals that have encountered antitrust troubles, Aetna -Humana, Anthem -Cigna and Walgreens -Rite Aid, actually narrowed, signaling investors may think they are more likely to close under a Trump administration. \nThe president does not directly decide if a merger is illegal under antitrust law. That is done by the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, which divide up the work of assessing mergers. If one of the agencies decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree. \nAT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on Wednesday his company was looking forward to working with Trump and was \"optimistic\" regulators would approve the deal. \nTime Warner's shares were last down 1 percent to $86.71, after trading as low as $85.60, while AT&T shares were up just under 1 percent at $37.24. The Dow and S&P 500 were both over 1 percent higher in late afternoon trading. \nMEDIA CONSOLIDATION IN FOCUS \nThe fate of the AT&T deal as well as several other large mergers, including the proposed combinations of Dow Chemical and DuPont, and Bayer and Monsanto , will ultimately be decided by Trump's nominees to lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department and the FTC. \n\"The deal is now more likely than not to be blocked. After all, it is rare for a presidential candidate to comment on such things during a campaign, but when that happens, the team he assembles generally take such statements as commands,\" New Street analyst Jonathan Chaplin said of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. \nChaplin said Trump's concerns appeared to be focused on media consolidation rather than on other sectors, and a failure of the AT&T deal would likely discourage other distribution companies from pursuing takeovers of a media company. \n\"We also believe that Trump may look at antitrust options for addressing consolidation in the tech community. Tech was overwhelming in its support of Clinton, something we suspect Trump knows and will remember,\" Chaplin wrote in a note, referring to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \nTelecom companies, such as AT&T and Verizon, are seeing their core businesses shrink. That has increased the appetite of telecom companies to buy media firms as they try to get hold of valuable content and diversify their revenue streams. \nAT&T's plan to buy Time Warner was expected to spark a new round of industry consolidation and give rise to deals that combine digital distribution and content. \nTrump's protectionist stance also raises the risk that some foreign corporations, including from China, may face higher hurdles in trying to take over American companies, dealmakers said. \n\"If you were thinking about doing a cross-border deal six months ago you weren't considering things like potential trade barriers, protectionism and tariffs. These are things you have to at least develop a view on and factor into the risk assessment of doing an overseas deal now,\" said Johs Worsoe, MUFG's head of investment banking & markets in the Americas.

AFP/Getty Images Radio commentators gather at a bar in Mexico City as U.S. poll results come in on November 8, 2016.\nMexico City ? Democrats gathered here for a ?Hillary Clinton Victory Party? in a popular BBQ joint. But Donald Trump victories in states such as Florida, North Carolina and Ohio sapped their enthusiasm.\nAmericans in the audience say they?ve always felt welcome in Mexico, even as Trump unleashed tough talk about America?s southern neighbor, calling Mexican migrants ?rapists? and robbers and promising to build a border wall. Some wonder how they will be treated if he wins.\n?They don?t blame us for Trump,? said Rosa Baum, a San Francisco native, working in Mexico with a human rights group. ?They?re often expressing empathy.?\nTrump?s strong performance appeared to cause alarm in the Mexican government. The newspaper Reforma reported the country?s foreign minister Cluadia Ruiz Massieu left her election war room for an urgent meeting in Los Pinos, the president?s residence.\nEarly returns showing a strong Trump performance also sent the peso plunging. Mexico has opened its economy over the past 25 years, betting big on NAFTA ? only to see a rising tide of protectionism ? causing concerns of a recession.\nOthers worry of mass deportations with a Trump administration, saying the sad-sacked pueblos many Mexicans left behind ? and prop up with remittances ? can?t handle an influx.\n?How could you create new jobs for 2 or 3 or even 4 million of deportees?? asked Rodolfo Soriano-Nu?ez, a sociologist in Mexico City.\nTrump?s promise of a wall is considered a non-starter in Mexico ? much less paying for it. But Soriano-N??ez said, ?If they actually go for the wall, the pressure will be very hard on the Mexican government.?\nIronically, Trump?s emergence comes as surveys show Mexicans, increasingly, embracing the U.S. and casting aside anti-Americanism. Some wonder if that will endure.\n?It?s so sad to see an ideology that?s so demeaning to the Mexican population,? said Elizabeth T?liz, a university student. ?We?re so close.

The approach with myF[__] myG[__] will still scale better, as can be seen from a plot with those two patterns. ? xavier 5 hours ago up vote 1 down vote \nTimes has the attributes Flat and Orderless . This means that any pattern that matches some combination of the arguments must, in principle, scan every permutation of arguments. Sometimes, the pattern matcher can optimize and avoid a full scan in the presence of explicit values and heads. Patterns of the form f[__] (i.e. f[BlankSequence[]] trigger such explicit head optimization whereas patterns like _f (i.e. Blank[f] ) do not -- presumably due to implementation details within the pattern matcher. \nAnalysis (current as of version 11.0.1) \nWe can reproduce the behaviour in a Flat Orderless function of our own devising: SetAttributes[times, {Flat, Orderless}] times[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, f[1], g[2]] /. times[_f, _g] :> fg // AbsoluteTiming // First (* 7.62321 *) times[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, f[1], g[2]] /. times[f[_], g[_]] :> fg // AbsoluteTiming // First (* 0.000033407 *) \nFlat Orderless Matching: The General Case \nLet us begin by examining the complexity of the general case when performing pattern matching upon a Flat Orderless function. Consider the following transformation: times[1, 2, 3, a] /. times[x_, a] :> {x, a} (* {times[1,2,3], a} *) \nTake note that the pattern matcher correctly identified that x matches multiple arguments to times , namely the leading prefix times[1, 2, 3] . We can observe the internal matching operation if we add conditions to the subpatterns that display some output: times[1, 2, 3, a] /. times[x_ /; (Echo[x, \"x_\"]; True), m_ /; (Echo[m, \"m_\"]; m===a)] :> {x, a} \nNotice how hard the pattern matcher had to work to get the final result. It had to scan through various permutations of subparts within the times[...] expression until it finally found its match. \nHelper Function \nWe will introduce a helper function tp that adjusts a pattern to display some output whenever it is matched: tp[patt_] := Module[{s}, Condition @@ Hold[s : patt, (Echo[{s}, patt]; True)]] \nThe Case At Hand \nWe can use this function to observe how pattern matcher operations grow exponentially as expression size increases for the problematic case at hand: times[1, 2, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[_f], tp[_g]] :> fg; times[1, 2, 3, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[_f], tp[_g]] :> fg; times[1, 2, 3, 4, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[_f], tp[_g]] :> fg; \nIn contrast, when we match using f[_] and g[_] instead of _f and _g , the number of operations remains constant: times[1, 2, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[f[_]], tp[g[_]]] :> fg; times[1, 2, 3, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[f[_]], tp[g[_]]] :> fg; times[1, 2, 3, 4, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[f[_]], tp[g[_]]] :> fg; \nClearly in the latter case the pattern matcher is applying an optimization. It need only scan the expression linearly to find the explicit heads f and g and then back-track to verify that the entire pattern is matched. We can see this explicitly if we also display the matched prefix: times[1, 2, 3, 4, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[___], tp[f[_]], tp[g[_]]] :> fg; \nEven a small case of the problematic expression will produce a lot of output if we trace the prefixes successively considered during its scan: times[1, 2, 3, f[1], g[2]] /. times[tp[___], tp[_f], tp[_g]] :> fg; \nNote that the matcher is considering numerous combinations until it finally finds the match. In fact, the output resembles the general case that we examined earlier although more rescanning is taking place here. \nThe pattern matcher is not recognizing that it has the same opportunity to optimize that it had in the previous expression. Apparently, its implementation will recognize that the pattern f[__] (i.e. f[BlankSequence[]] has an explicit head but it fails to make that recognition for _f (i.e. Blank[f] ). My guess is that this is an implementation coincidence and that the code is explicitly looking for the (meta)pattern _[BlankSequence[]] but not Blank[_] . The pattern matcher is rumoured to be an interesting piece of code so it might not necessarily be easy for WRI to introduce or maintain optimizations of this sort. \nDisclaimer \nBeware that it is difficult to trace the operation of the pattern matcher from high-level code. Any change to a pattern can alter the execution strategy chosen by the matcher (e.g. a change such as the trick used here of introducing a condition to display output). The examples shown in this response are meant to illustrate the principles involved rather than offering a strict step-by-step description of pattern matching operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-13T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-13T08:32:55.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

Baba, Vanga, the blind Bulgarian clairvoyant, who died 20 years ago, is believed to have predicted the rise of the ISIS, the fall of the twin towers, the 2004 Tsunami, and the global warming, among a host of other events. ?Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds.? ?The wolves will be howling in a bush and innocent blood will gush,? is, according to her followers, what she said about the fall of the twin towers. Born as Vangelia Pandeva Dimitrova, in Strumica, Macedonia, Baba Vanga, mysteriously lost her eyesight when she was 12, during a massive storm. She went missing for a few days, and it is during one of these days, that she had her first vision. Baba Vanga rose to popularity as she started to make predictions, and developed a healing touch, during the World War II. Several dignitaries visited the mystic during the years that she was active, including the Bulgarian tsar, Boris III. Before she died in 1996 from breast cancer, she had said that her gift would be passed on to a 10 year old girl, living in France, who will then take on from her. Her house has since been converted into a museum.\nHere are 13 predictions that the Blind Baba made for 2016 and beyond:\nBarack Obama will be the last president of the US: Baba Vanga had predicted that the 44 th US president would be an African American, but she had also added that he would be the last one. According to her, he would leave office at a time when the country would be in economic ruins, and there would be a huge divide between the northern and southern states ? as was the case during the American Civil War.\nEurope will cease to exist: According to Baba Vanga, the continent will cease to exist by 2016, and all that would remain will be empty spaces and wasteland, nearly devoid of any form of life. She is reported to have said that chemical weapons would be used by extremists against Europe.\nMuslims will invade Europe: The blind mystic had also predicted that Muslims will invade Europe, and there will be widespread destruction by extremists, which will go on for many years, until the continent ceases to exist. She had also predicted that a Great Muslim War will begin in Syria.\nChina will become the new super power: As per her predictions, China is set to become the new superpower in 2018, bringing an end to the United States and its economy. According to her, the exploiters (the developed nations) will become the exploited (the third world). In 2011, the International Monetary Fund had also predicted that China?s economy will overtake that of the US in 2016, emerging as the new superpower.\nHunger eradication: Baba Vanga has predicted that hunger will get eradicated sometime between 2025 and 2028.\nOn to Venus: Humans will travel to Venus, according to the Baba, in search of new energy sources. They might even set up a colony there.\nRome as the capital of the Islamic caliphate: Islam will finish invading the whole of Europe by 2043, and Rome will be the capital of the new caliphate.\nIce caps melting: According to the Baba, ice caps will melt by 2045. The rate at which the ice caps are melting already due to global warming, does seem to suggest the same.\nCloning of organs: As per Baba Vanga?s predictions, body organs will be cloned in 2046, and that would be the easiest method of treatment.\nUS attacking Muslim dominated Europe: By 2066, the US will attack Muslim dominated Europe using climate change weapon, and will try to retake Rome and bring back Christianity.\nThe return of Communism: By 2076, communism will return to Europe and the rest of the world.\nUnderwater civilisations: By 2130, civilisations will learn how to live under water, with the help of aliens.\nThe death of the Earth: By 3797, everything on Earth will cease to exist.

The planets are easy, and if you know where the asteroids exist, you've got a good handle on a good portion of the solar system. However, what about comets? Do you know about their ancient home? \nIf you can say where comets come from, then give yourself a pat on the back! These objects \"live\" in the outermost part of our solar system called the O?rt Cloud ( named after the man who suggested its existence, Jan O?r t) ? a spherical collection of icy bodies at a distance of between 5,000 and 100,000 astronomical units (AU). Some astronomers think it might stretch out as far as 3 light-years and it's a deep-freeze containing evidence of the early history of the solar system. What's Out in the O?rt Cloud? \nThe O?rt Cloud' is named for astronomer Jaan O?rt, who first hypothesized its existence in 1950. It's populated by icy objects made mostly of mixtures of frozen water, methane , ethane , carbon monoxide , and hydrogen cyanide , mixed with rock and dust grains. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Best Universities in the United States Planetary scientists estimate the Oort Cloud has up to 2 trillion icy of these objects orbiting the Sun, many of which make their way into solar orbit and become comets. \nIf these icy objects exist so far out in space, how do they become comets that go hurtling in orbit around the Sun? There are several ideas about that. It's possible that stars passing nearby, or tidal interactions within the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy , or interactions with gas and dust clouds give these icy bodies a kind of \"push\" out of their orbits in the Oort Cloud. With their motions changed, they're more likely to \"fall\" in toward the Sun on new orbits that take thousands of years for one trip around the Sun. These are called \"long-period\" comets. Comets and the Kuiper Belt \nThere are other comets, called \"short-period\" comets that travel around the Sun in much shorter times, usually less than 200 years. They come from the Kuiper Belt , which is a roughly disk-shaped region that spans out from the orbit of Neptune . The Kuiper Belt has been in the news for the past couple of decades as astronomers discover new worlds within its boundaries. Dwarf planet Pluto is a denizen of the Kuiper Belt, joined by Charon (its largest satellite), and the dwarf planets Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Sedna. The Kuiper Belt extends from about 30 to 55 AU and astronomers estimate it has hundreds of thousands of icy bodies larger than 62 miles across. It might also have about a trillion comets. Exploring the Parts of the O?rt Cloud \nThe O?rt Cloud is divided into two parts. The first is the source of what are called \"long-period\" comets (those that take many centuries to orbit the Sun). It may have trillions of cometary nuclei. The second is an inner Cloud shaped roughly like a doughnut. It, too, is very rich in cometary nuclei and other dwarf-planet-sized objects. Astronomers recently found one small world that has part of its orbit in the inner O?rt Cloud. As they find more, they will be able to refine their ideas about where those objects originated back in the solar system's early history. A Treasury of Solar System History \nThe O?rt Cloud's cometary nuclei and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) are likely remnants from the formation of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Astronomers think the O?rt Cloud's icy planetesimals formed much closer to the Sun early in history, alongside the formation of the planets and asteroids. Gravitational interactions with the young gas giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) slingshotted the icy worldlets out to form the Cloud. \nIt's also possible that O?rt Cloud objects came from materials in the birth nebula where the Sun and its siblings formed together, a jointly shared \"pool\" of icy objects from protoplanetary disks that lay very close together. As the newborn stars drifted apart, they dragged along the materials from other protoplanetary disks and those ultimately populated the Cloud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-13T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-13T15:36:22.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 13, "shares": 13, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

Hindi journalist shot dead by bike-borne assailants in Bihar Hindi journalist shot dead by bike-borne assailants in Bihar November 12, 2016 11:26 IST \nDharmendra Singh, a journalist with the Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskar, was shot dead by unidentified assailants in Bihar?s Rohtas in wee hours on Saturday. Singh was standing at a tea stall near his house early in morning when three bike-borne assailants opened fire on him, peppering his chest with bullets. The incident took place near Amra Lake in the Mufassil police station area. Locals immediately rushed Singh to the Sadar Hospital in Sasaram, where he received primary treatment and was referred to Varanasi. However, Singh succumbed to injuries on his way to Varanasi. A case has been registered and the police is investigating to nab the assailants. Earlier in October this year, a local television journalist was allegedly shot dead by motorcycle-borne miscreants in Dheena area in Uttar Pradesh, making it the third such incident in four months. Hemant Yadav, 45, worked with a news channel was shot by bike-borne miscreants, Superintendent of police Amit Verma said. In June, journalist Jagendra Singh was allegedly set on fire during a police raid at his house in Shahjahanpur. His family alleged that the police officials set him on fire. Singh, who was in his 50s, succumbed to injuries on June 8. An FIR was registered against six persons including a UP minister, who was said to be angry over Singh?s Facebook posts about his illegal mining activities and land grabbing. In another incident, two persons in Bareilly district, allegedly killed a part-time reporter from a local Hindi daily Sanjay Pathak, in August. Police said Pathak, 42, was hit several times on the head with some heavy object and might have died of excessive bleeding.

Photo by Domino's \nYou can call it pie in the sky, but pizza delivery is now a real thing -- at least in the Land Down Under. \nDomino's Pizza Enterprises said Wednesday it had completed what it called the world's first delivery of a pizza to a customer in New Zealand. Under the watch of a team of drone experts, the unmanned aerial vehicle used GPS navigation to autonomously deliver Peri-Peri Chicken and Chicken and Cranberry pizzas to a backyard in Whangaparaoa, about 20 miles north of Auckland. \nDrones have grown in popularity among big retailers such as Amazon and Walmart, which are continually looking for new ways to get a jump on the competition and attract customers. The small, commercial aerial drones could avoid the delays of terrestrial deliveries by flying above traffic and avoiding circuitous roadways. \n\"They can avoid traffic congestion and traffic lights, and safely reduce the delivery time and distance by traveling directly to customers' homes,\" Domino's Group CEO Don Meij said in a statement. \"This is the future.\" \nDomino's isn't the only food chain looking to the heavens for its next delivery options. Chipotle Mexican Grill announced a partnership in September with Alphabet's Project Wing to test delivery of burritos to hungry students at the Virginia Tech. \nBut not all is smooth sailing in the skies. Earlier this month, Project Wing reportedly scrapped a partnership with Starbucks to deliver coffee to the caffeine-deprived masses as part of a cost-cutting move. \nDomino's plans to use the information gathered from these flights to expand the service to Australia, Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Japan and Germany.

But in every democracy I believe there is a government and there is an opposition, in a healthy democracy, and we are the opposition.\"\nMany placards could be seen in the crowd with messages against racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, \"homophobia\" and \"white nationalism.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-19T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-19T19:39:40.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}

The horse race is trivial, people always tell journalists? write about stuff that matters. Reporters did just that, digging into Trump?s charitable giving, Hillary Clinton?s emails, and Bernie Sanders?s economic plan. Still, very few people in the mainstream press expected Trump to win, thereby influencing their coverage?newsrooms drew up plans to cover a Clinton transition, and correspondents penned final-days-of-Trump features .\nLatest from Politics A Deadly Question \nIn the aftermath, many of the immediate post-mortems blamed a coastal bubble: Too many journalists had grown nearsighted in urban Democratic enclaves, the reasoning went, blinding them to what was taking place in Middle America. If more reporters actually spent time in fly-over country, instead of jetting through for a rally, they?d understand why Donald Trump won voters over. And if national newsrooms prioritized hiring folks who didn?t graduate from elite journalism programs?and maybe didn?t graduate from college at all?well, that wouldn?t hurt, either.\nA critique is most devastating when it is true. The American journalistic class has certainly diverged sharply from the country it covers. In 1960, nearly a third of reporters and editors had never attended a single year of college; in 2015, only 8.3 percent could say the same , according to Census figures extracted with the help of the University of Minnesota?s IPUMS project . That year 46 percent of adults 25 and older nationwide had never attended a university.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-19T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-19T14:05:03.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 15}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "facebook": {"likes": 782, "shares": 782, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 34}}}

Every week during the final season, EW is asking those involved with the show to look back on one of their favorite moments from the series. So grab your tissues and join us on this trip down a vampire-filled memory lane. \nThis week, Sara Canning remembers the great Aunt Jenna? \nThe very first thing that popped into my mind about the show would be the first episode that we shot after the pilot, because everybody had moved to Atlanta and we were excited. I look back at us as these kids who were so excited about the potential of what the show could be. It was the first pilot I ever worked on and it was the first time I?d ever been a regular on a show. It was pretty incredible to move with this amazing group of people and to get to know a new city. It was the first time I?d ever lived in the U.S. We?d take trips on the weekends and we?d always be going out to the lake. I remember that first season, particularly the first few months and shooting before the show aired, as this really wild, exciting time. It was pretty special. \nI loved the dinner party scene at the Salvatore house or the barbecue we hosted when Mason rolled back into town. I remember those being such fun days, just having a big group of us. I think we were playing Pictionary at the barbecue with Mason. I just remember those days so fondly. The cast is a group who?s so eager to laugh and prank and have a good time. I think I miss that most about the cast as an entirety ? they just really want to have a good time. And they do. There?s a lot of darkness in the show so I think it?s really imperative that everybody be able to have that kind of light-hearted relationship as well. \nI also loved when Jenna had no idea about the vampires because it made for a lot of great lines. It was always fun to play that, be one of the only people still in the dark about the goings on in Mystic Falls. \nThe day I found out Jenna was going to die was a really hard day, because I still had two and a half episodes left to shoot. I was really sad. I have such a better perspective on it now than I ever could have then because I understand so much about what makes great TV and how people become invested in characters and story lines, that there needs to be a real weight sometimes in order for a story to progress and for other characters to evolve. I don?t think I could?ve even understood then how important Jenna?s death was for Elena?s character, in particular, but at the time it was really hard. \nI?ve luckily maintained a lot of really close friendships with a lot of people who worked on the show, both the cast and the crew. And the fans of this show are incredible because I still feel like a part of the show even though I haven?t been physically on the show in so long. One of the greatest compliments I?ve gotten from fans of the show is them saying, ?I wish I had an aunt like Jenna.? That?s really cool. I thought she was such a great female role model for Elena and Jeremy, even though she was a little bit of a partier and she was trying to figure things out. I just loved how honest and transparent she was about everything. \nI feel very lucky to have played her. It?s really nice to see that, even though she was only really around for two seasons, I think that she had some sort of lasting impact in the sense that her death really did affect particularly Elena and Jeremy and maybe Alaric too ? hopefully. It was a great lesson for me near the beginning of my career about television and what makes exciting television. I feel really grateful for the kindness people have shown me and the outrage that people still express to me about her death. I feel really proud of them. Eight seasons is an incredible feat and I?m very happy to be a part of the family. \nThe Vampire Diaries airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.
