Oh, the implications! – Megha Jan 10 at 0:56 2 Actually we do know because it says he never could again – a_a Jan 10 at 1:03 @ulmo \"he could never again appear fair to the eyes of Men\" does not preclude appearing fair to other races; what a Man finds fair may not be the same thing a Dwarf (or an Ent, or any other kind of creature) would find fair – Jason Baker Jan 10 at 1:05 1 Hmm, that is an interesting point...seems a bit strange that it could depend on race. I saw this as an analogous thing that happened to morgoth. He invested all of his power into evil such that he was never again able to appear fair to anyone and maintained the shape of the tyrant of utumno. I feel like saurons experience mirrors this...but your point is taken – a_a Jan 10 at 1:08 1 @ulmo Tolkien talks about that briefly in \"Notes on Motives\", in Morgoth's Ring . Sauron put much, much less of himself into the Ring (compared to what Morgoth put into Arda), which is why Morgoth was limited in ways Sauron wasn't – Jason Baker Jan 10 at 1:09 up vote 7 down vote \nNo. From Akallabeth: \"he could never again appear fair to the eyes of men, yet his spirit arose out of the deep and passed as a shadow and a black wind over the sea back to middle earth\". Note that after he returns to middle earth he is in possession of the ring, thus he cannot appear in fair form even with the ring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-19T19:52:54.208+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
