Everyone needs to take responsibility for this, and if they do that, then we have a chance to get it back on track again,\" he said. \nHowever, former Bok flyhalf Naas Botha did question some of the appointments within the coaching team. \n\"Sometimes you have to say we did make the wrong calls, the wrong appointments,\" he said. \"We talk about defence every week, we talk about attack, we talk about the kicking game. Somebody needs to take responsibility. We can't accept this.\" \nAlexander said there would be much introspection in the coming months. \nTEPID BACKING \n\"All of us within South African rugby need to look at ourselves and ask what we could have done differently in aid of the Springbok cause,\" he said in a statement from South African Rugby shortly after the latest defeat. \n\"Those questions will be asked at the end of the season when we will undertake a full review of the year and what new interventions may be needed to turn things around.\" \nHe then appeared to give tepid backing to Coetzee and his management team. \n\"We know they are better than this,\" he said. \"Our job is to take steps to do as much as we possibly can to make sure we are not in a similar position in 12 months' time.\" \nThe Boks will end their dismal season against Wales in Cardiff next Saturday, looking to avoid another unwanted record: they have never lost eight tests in a single year.
