Ngayon naman, let's be light, let's have fun,\" Alviar told ABS-CBN News' MJ Felipe. \n\"It's age-appropriate and excited na ako kasi alam ko na magiging masaya kami habang ginagawa ito and I'm sure people will also have fun watching it.\" \nAlviar also said that fans can expect something new from Bernardo and Padilla in the film, which currently does not have a final title yet. \n\"How do we make it different? What haven't they done? What haven't I done? At kung ano na iyong babagay sa kanila given their maturity now,\" she said in explaining the inspiration for the project. \"There has to be something different the audience can watch out for.\" \nPadilla and Berando said they're excited to learn something new from Alviar. \n\"Pahihirapan pa rin kami ni direk,\" Padilla quipped.\"Pero iyon iyung maganda doon, doon naman iyong mahahasa ka. Hindi naman puwede laging madali lang lahat para sa iyo, hindi ka niyan matututo.\" \nAlviar's \"Crazy Beautiful You\" made more than P320 million in the local box office, making it the most successful film of Padilla and Bernardo to date. \nShare", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-19T19:54:24.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 46, "shares": 46, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
