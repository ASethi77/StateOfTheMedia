When you shoot 30 percent, you aren’t going to win a game.” \nThe Red Storm (2-2) pulled within 55-53 with 8:22 remaining in the second half on a Kassoum Yakwe layup, but didn’t score again until Bashir Ahmed tipped in his own miss with 2:23 left. By that point, though, Michigan State (3-2) led by a dozen. \nMarcus LoVett led St. John’s with 20 points — 13 after halftime. Mullin, though, lamented the lack of ball movement — citing the team’s eight assists as a sign the ball got “stuck.” \n“That’s really not the kind of game I want to play,” Mullin said. \nThe Red Storm will face VCU on Thursday in the loser’s bracket on Day 2 of the three-games-in-three-days event. The Spartans advanced to the semifinals to face No. 20 Baylor, which beat VCU, 71-63. \nWhile the Spartans advanced and Michigan State coach Tom Izzo saw some positives, he said there is plenty to improve on. \n“It’s still not smooth for us,” Izzo said. “It might not be for a while.” \nFreshman Miles Bridges had 22 points and a season-high 15 rebounds to lead the Spartans. \nEron Harris added 14 points for the Spartans, while Tum Tum Nairn Jr. — a native of nearby Nassau — matched his career high of 13 points in his return to the Bahamas. \nMichigan State has had a bumpy start to the season, starting with a loss to Arizona on a last-second basket in the opener. \nThe Spartans managed just 48 points in a loss to current No. 1 Kentucky and barely beat Florida Gulf Coast at home over the weekend. It’s part of a tough opening month that concludes with a trip to preseason No. 1 Duke in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge. \n“There’s some frustrating moments, and it’s not all their fault,” Izzo said. “It’s just the cards we’ve been dealt. … I’m asking a lot of these guys. And you know what? I’m going to keep demanding it because that’s what we do here.” \n— with AP ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-24T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-24T11:01:16.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
