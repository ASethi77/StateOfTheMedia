Hudson and Benjamin Sisko were close personal friends, having graduated from Starfleet Academy together. Hudson also knew Curzon Dax , who was apparently privy to personal information concerning the officer. He was married to Gretchen Hudson, who died in the late 2360s . \nHudson was like his friend Benjamin Sisko in many ways; he was an experienced officer and an able leader who seemed to inspire trust in those he worked with. Hudson, however, was leading a double life; although assigned by Starfleet as the attaché to the planets in the Demilitarized Zone, he was an influential leader of the Maquis . After years of seeing the suffering and abuse of the colonists by the Cardassians , he joined the separatist organization and used his Starfleet position to secure intelligence and supplies for them. \nIn 2370 , Commander Sisko uncovered Hudson's deception while investigating the destructive implosion of the Bok'Nor and a recent kidnapping of Gul Dukat . At first, Calvin wanted his friend's covert assistance by allowing the rebel force to use DS9 as a repair station for their ships, expressing that it would have been nice to work closely once again; Sisko angrily refused and the two parted ways. Subsequently, Hudson led an attack wing of Maquis ships against three Starfleet runabouts , managing to hold his own and finally escape. ( DS9 : \" The Maquis, Part I \", \" The Maquis, Part II \") \nHudson died in a skirmish with the Cardassians while fighting for the Maquis in 2373 , and was described by fellow Starfleet defector Michael Eddington as a martyr for the cause. Despite their enmity, Sisko was deeply saddened by news of Hudson's death.
