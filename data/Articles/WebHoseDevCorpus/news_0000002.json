And: that is an excellent source of entropy, especially when used with a hardware source of entropy. I'd recommend you watch the excellent lecture held at 32c3 on misunderstandings and reality of /dev/random: \nSo: Use your hardware generator to feed your operating system's entropy pool, and let OpenSSL feed off that. Directly feeding OpenSSL from your hardware might work, but is not really any better â€“ and more importantly, you eliminate the intermediate step of dumping randomness to a file, which might leave traces that could later on be used to reconstruct key generation.
