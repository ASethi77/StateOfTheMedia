According to Chicago police, Jovan Wilson, 15, was inside his home about 6:45pm CDT when two people broke in. An argument ensued and he was shot in the head, according to police. Wilson was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. According to Davis, the two people who broke in were a 17-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy who pulled a gun. \"Unfortunately, this is another example of a 15-year-old with a gun that he never should have had,\" said Davis. Wilson's mother had just left to pick up food before the shooting, leaving the boy with his two brothers, ages 8 and 14; his 16-year-old sister, and an uncle, Davis said.  //reut.rs/2gqFolc", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-20T02:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-20T01:20:07.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": "", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 0, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}}
